<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Patagonia is a country about which little is known to the world
in general, books dealing with it being few and far between, while
the aspect of that quaint tail of South America and its wild denizens
has practically never before been pictorially brought under the
eye of the public. The following pages have been written with
the idea of familiarising my readers with the conditions of life
in Patagonia, and of reproducing as strongly as possible the
impressions we gathered during our journey through regions most
interesting and varied, and, as regards a certain portion of them,
hitherto unvisited and unexplored.</p>

<p>The original motive with which these travels were undertaken
lay in a suggestion that a couple of years ago created a considerable
stir amongst many besides scientific people, namely, that
the prehistoric Mylodon might possibly still survive hidden in the
depths of the forests of the Southern Andes. In a lecture delivered
on June 21, 1900, before the Zoological Society, Professor E. Ray
Lancaster, the Director of the British Museum of Natural
History, said: "It is quite possible&mdash;I don't want to say more
than that&mdash;that he (the Mylodon) still exists in some of the
mountainous regions of Patagonia." Mr. Pearson, the proprietor
of the <i>Daily Express</i>, most generously financed the Expedition
in the interests of science, and entrusted me with the task of
sifting all the evidence for or against the chances of survival
obtainable on the spot.</p>

<p>During the whole time I spent in Patagonia I came upon no
single scrap of evidence of any kind which would support the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIV" id="Page_XIV">xiv</a></span>
idea of the survival of the Mylodon. I hoped to have found the
Indian legends of some interest in this connection, and I took the
utmost pains to sift most thoroughly all stories and rumours that
could by any means be supposed to refer to any unknown animal.
Of this part of the subject I have given a full account elsewhere.</p>

<p>There then remained to us but one thing more to do, and
that was to examine as far as we could&mdash;I will not say the forests
of the Andes, for they are primeval forests, dense and heavily
grown, and, moreover, cover hundreds of square miles of unexplored
country&mdash;but the nature of these forests, so as to be able to come
to some conclusion on the point under discussion. This we did,
with the result that I personally became convinced&mdash;and my
opinion was shared by my companions&mdash;that the Mylodon does
not survive in the depths of the Andean forests. For there is a
singular absence of animal life in the forests. The deeper we
penetrated, the less we found. It is a well-known fact that, where
the larger forms of animal life exist, a number of the lesser
creatures are to be found co-existing with them, the conditions
favouring the life of the former equally conducing to the welfare
of the latter. Our observation of the forests therefore led us to
conclude that no animal such as the Mylodon is at all likely to be
existing among them. This is presumptive evidence, but it is
strong, being based on deductions not drawn from a single instance
but from general experience.</p>

<p>Still I would not offer my opinion as an ultimate answer to
the problem. In addition to the regions visited by our Expedition,
there are, as I have said, hundreds and hundreds of square miles
about, and on both sides of the Andes, still unpenetrated by man.
A large portion of this country is forested, and it would be presumptuous
to say that in some hidden valley far beyond the
present ken of man some prehistoric animal may not still exist.
Patagonia is, however, not only vast, but so full of natural
difficulties, that I believe the exhaustive penetration of its recesses
will be the work not of one man or of one party of men, but the
result of the slow progress of human advance into these regions.</p>

<p>I have recorded some of my observations upon the habits of
Patagonian game, and have written somewhat fully upon that most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XV" id="Page_XV">xv</a></span>
interesting race, the Tehuelche Indians, but I have abstained from
very lengthy appendices, for these would be of purely scientific
interest.</p>

<p>It is my hope to be able to return to Patagonia and to go
further into the many interesting subjects to which my attention
was drawn. In any book that may result from this second journey,
I look forward to including lists of various zoological, palæontological,
and botanical collections, all the materials for which have
not at the moment of writing arrived in England.</p>

<p>I would very cordially acknowledge the unfailing help which
Dr. F. P. Moreno has accorded to me in every way, and would
specially thank him for the photographs and maps he has allowed
me to use in the following pages. My thanks are also due to Dr.
A. Smith Woodward, F.R.S., for his kind permission to reproduce
his description of the Mylodon skin and other remains discovered
at Consuelo Cove by Dr. Moreno; to Dr. Moreno for permitting
me to reprint his account of that interesting discovery, and to Mr.
Oldfield Thomas, F.R.S., for allowing me to make use of his
description of <i>Felis concolor pearsoni</i>, the new sub-species of puma
which we brought back. I further offer my acknowledgments to
the Zoological Society, in whose "Proceedings" the two first-mentioned
papers originally appeared.</p>

<p>My best thanks are also due to the Royal Geographical Society,
who lent us instruments and gave us every aid in their power, and
also to Dr. Rendle and Mr. James Britten, of the Botanical Department
of the British Museum, for their kindness in preparing a
botanical appendix.</p>

<p>I must record my indebtedness to Mr. John Guille Millais for
the pains he took with his illustrations for this book. Before I
started, my friend, Mr. Millais, drew me some sketches of huemul,
guanaco, and other Patagonian animals. These I showed to the
Tehuelches, and was once taken aback by being offered a commission
to draw an Indian's dogs. He offered me a trained horse
as payment. The praise of the "man who knows" is, after all,
the great reward of art.</p>

<p>My thanks are also due to Mr. Edward Hawes, who kindly
overlooked the proofs of this book to correct the spelling of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XVI" id="Page_XVI">xvi</a></span>
Camp-Spanish. And I would add the name of Mr. Frank A.
Juckes, who saw to the outfitting of a medicine-chest.</p>

<p>I would not omit grateful mention of Señor Garcia Merou,
the late Minister of Agriculture of the Argentine Republic, of the
late Señor Rivadavia, the then Minister of Marine, to Señor
Josué Moreno, to Messrs. Krabbé and Higgins; also to Mr.
Ernest Cattle, Mr. Theobald, of Trelew, and to the many kind
friends who live in the Argentine Republic.</p>

<p>I am indebted to my friend, Alfred James Jenkinson, Scholar
of Hertford College, Oxford, for his kindness in preparing photographs
for reproduction.</p>

<p>Most of all I owe a debt (a debt which runs yearly into compound
interest) to my mother, who is accountable for anything
that is worth while in this book, and who has collaborated in its
production.</p>

<p>Patagonia forms the southern
point or end of the South American
continent and extends, roughly speaking,
from about parallel 40° to the Straits of
Magellan. Up to very recent times the
geography of this southern portion of the
New World has been in a nebulous condition.
Vast tracts of the interior of Patagonia
are as practically waste and empty
to-day as they were in the long-past ages.
It is certainly curious that this land should
have been left so completely out of view
when the great overspill of European
humanity looked overseas in search of new
homes where they might dwell and expand
and find ample means of livelihood.</p>

<div class="figright"><a name="i_019b" id="i_019b"></a>
<img src="images/i_019b.jpg" width="178" height="325" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ONE OF OUR GAUCHOS</p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the description of Patagonia given in the earlier part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
the last century by Darwin had something to do with this omission.
He spoke of it as a land having "the curse of sterility" upon it. He
dwelt on its desolate appearance, its "dreary landscape," and it
would seem that his undervaluing of the country of which, after all, he
had but a short and curtailed experience, influenced the whole circle
of the nations, with the result that only during the last thirty years
or so have the peoples who desire to colonise been discovering how
desirable and profitable is the great neglected land of the south.</p>

<p>Patagonia has grown to its present condition very rapidly.
Not so long ago it was almost entirely given up to Indians and
the countless herds of guanaco. Now there are farms upon the
coast, and a few settlements, such as Gallegos with its 3000 inhabitants,
and Sandy Point or Punta Arenas, still more populous
with 11,000. Behind this narrow strip of sparsely inhabited
coast-land the immense extent of the interior lies vacant.</p>

<p>Patagonia strikes the traveller as huge, elemental. Its natural
conformation is stamped with these characteristics. From the
River Negro on the north it tapers gradually to the Straits of
Magellan on the south. Three great parallel divisions, running
north and south, of plain, lake and mountain, each strongly
marked, make up the face of the country. From the shores of
the Atlantic the pampas rise in gently graduated terraces to the
range of the Andes, while between them are strung a mighty
network of lakes and lagoons, some connected by rivers, others by
channels, many of which shift and alter under the influence of
climate and other local causes. From the sea to the Sierra
Nevada stretch the pampas, all tussocky grass, thorn, guanacos
and mirages. On the western rim of the pampas the Cordillera
stand against the sky, a tumult of mountains climbing upwards,
their loftier gorges choked with glaciers, their hollows holding
great lakes, ice-cold, ice-blue, and about their bases and their
bastions thousands of square miles of shaggy forests, of which but
the mere edges have yet been explored.</p>

<p>Within its 300,000 square miles of surface Patagonia offers
the most extreme and abrupt contrasts. Flat pampa with hardly
a visible undulation, mountains almost inaccessible in their steep
escarpments. Side by side they lie, crossing many degrees of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
latitude, the contrast descending to the smallest particulars, mountain
against plain, forest as opposed to thorn-scrub, rain against
sun. The wind only is common to both more or less, though
it is felt to a far greater degree upon the pampa. The contrast
extends to the coasts. The eastern coast is a level treeless
series of downs with few bays to offer shelter to shipping; the
western coast, on the contrary, is grooved and notched with fjords,
and the beetling headlands loom dark with forests.</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_021" id="i_021"></a>
<img src="images/i_021.jpg" width="550" height="409" alt="" />
<p class="caption">AMONG THE ANDES</p>
</div>

<p>Roughly speaking, the country to the east of the Andes belongs
to Argentina, that on the west to Chili: between them lies a long
strip of disputed territory. From this great dividing-line rivers
flow into both oceans, into the Atlantic and into the Pacific. On
the eastern side of the range, where our travels took us, the rivers
cut transversely across the continent to the Atlantic. Such are the
Chubut, the Deseado, the southern Chico, which joins with the Santa
Cruz in a wide estuary before reaching the ocean, and the Gallegos.
At the mouth of each of these a settlement has sprung up.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p>On the western side the mountains approach more closely to
the sea, some of the glaciers on the heights of the Andes actually
overhanging the Pacific. The shore is there deeply indented with
winding and intricate fjords, and dense dripping forests grow
rankly in the humid climate, for the rainfall on the Chilian side
of the Cordillera is extraordinarily heavy.</p>

<p>Patagonia is the home of big distances. The Boer used to
boast that he could not see the smoke of his neighbour's chimney.
On the Atlantic coastland of Patagonia it is often three, four or
five days' ride to the nearest farm. The holdings are measured
not by the acre or any analogous standard but by the square league.
One farm alone in Tierra del Fuego is 400 square leagues in extent.
The distances are at first appalling. A man accustomed to cities
would here feel forlorn indeed. One stands face to face with the
elemental. As you travel into the interior, Nature, with her large
loose grasp, enfolds you. There is no possibility of being mentally
propped up by one's fellow man. Empty leagues upon leagues
surround you on every side, "the inverted bowl we call the sky"
above.</p>

<p>Who, having once seen them, can forget the pampas?
Evening, and the sun sloping over the edge of the plain like an
angry eye, an inky-blue mirage half blotting it out, in the middle
distance grass rolling like an ocean to the horizon, lean thorn, and
a mighty roaring wind.</p>

<p>Out there in the heart of the country you seem to stand
alone, with nothing nearer or more palpable than the wind, the
fierce mirages and the limitless distances.</p>

<p>This wild land, ribbed and spined by one of the greatest mountain
chains in the world, appears to have been the last habitation of
the greater beasts of the older ages. It is now the last country
of all to receive man, or rather its due share of human population.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that this is the nearest bulk of land to
the Antarctic continent. It thrusts forth its vast mass far into
southern waters, and beyond lie a covey of islands, small and large,
upon the outermost of which is situated the famous Cape Horn.</p>

<p>On the Antarctic continent there is no life to speak of. In
Patagonia, the nearest large land, the human race has been,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
through the centuries, represented by a few thousand nomad
Indians, who in their long rovings followed certain well-known
trails, from which only a very rare and venturesome individual
thought of deviating. Far outside these paths dwelt, according to
the native imagination, dangers and terrors unknown. You can
follow the same trails to-day. Picture to yourself a dozen or
twenty field-paths running side by side, obliterated by the fingers
of the spring, and invisible under your feet, but strangely growing
into distinctness half a mile ahead, waving onward towards the
pampas. Such is the Indian trail.</p>

<p>People in England, one finds, are divided into two groups as
to their opinions of the Patagonian climate. One group maintains
that the country must be tropical, since it is included in the continent
of South America; the other that it is an ice-bound region,
for the good reason that it lies close to Tierra del Fuego. Oddly
enough, both are in a degree justified, for the summers there are
comparatively hot, but the severity of the winter, when snow lies
deep on the country, and cutting winds blow down from the frozen
heights during those months that bring to us our long English
evenings, is undeniable.</p>

<p>Some day, no doubt, the land will lose its untamed aspect; it
will become, as others are, moulded by the hand of man, and
expectant of him. But now the great words of one whose eyes
never rested on Andean loneliness marvellously describes it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>A land where no man comes nor hath come</p>
<p>Since the making of the world,</p>
<p>But ever the wind shrills.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The discovery of Patagonia dates from the early part of the
year 1520, when that most intrepid of explorers, Ferdinand
Magellan, forced his way doggedly down the east coast in the
teeth of continuous storms. With his little fleet of five vessels
he pushed on in the hope, which few if any of his companions
shared, of finding a strait joining the two great oceans, the Atlantic
and the Pacific. Upon what foundation he based this belief cannot
now be certainly told, but the analogy of the Cape of Good Hope
and rumours that obtained among the geographers and seafaring
captains of the day, helped, no doubt, to confirm his own idea that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
some such outlet existed. As early as 1428, a map of the world,
described by one Antonio Galvao as "most rare and excellent,"
showed the Straits of Magellan under the name of the "Dragon's
Tail." This map, being carefully kept in the treasuries of Portugal,
was, it may fairly be presumed, known to Magellan. Also there
were two globes, made in Nuremberg shortly before he sailed,
in which the channel between the great seas was clearly indicated.</p>

<p>For all that, the existence of a passage was far from being
an established fact, but Magellan undauntedly continued his voyage
down the Patagonian coast in search of it. He reached the
harbour now known as San Julian on March 31, 1520, and there
proposed to winter.</p>

<p>Almost at once the famous mutiny against his authority broke
out, headed by those who desired to turn back, and who had
no faith in the existence of the strait. One of the rebel captains
was stabbed upon his own deck, a second executed ashore and
a third marooned. The commander of the fourth ship, the
<i>Santiago</i>, was a friend of Magellan's, who stood by his leader
throughout the troubled time.</p>

<p>Weeks passed by, the winter settled down upon them with
great severity, and yet no sign of native inhabitants had been
perceived upon the shore. The Captain-General sent out an expedition
to go thirty leagues into the interior, but the men returned
with a disheartening account of the country, which they described
as impassable, barren of the necessities of life, and, as far as their
experience went, entirely devoid of inhabitants. But one day not
long after, a native appeared upon the beach who cut antics
and sang while he tossed sand upon his head. This man was successfully
lured on board of Magellan's ship. He was dressed in skins,
with clumsy boots of the same material, which last fact is supposed
by some authorities to have led Magellan to call the people the
Patagaos, or big feet. Pigafetta, an Italian who accompanied the
exploring fleet, wrote an account of this Patagonian's appearance.
"So tall was this man that we came up to the level of his waist-belt.
He was well enough made, and had a broad face, painted red,
with yellow circles round his eyes, and two heart-shaped spots on
his cheeks." He further says the man was armed with a bow and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
arrows, the bow being short and thick and the arrows tipped
with black and white flint heads. In another place Pigafetta
asserts that the least of the Patagonians
was taller than the tallest men in Castile.</p>

<div class="figright"><a name="i_025" id="i_025"></a>
<img src="images/i_025.jpg" width="210" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A TEHUELCHE CACIQUE</p>
</div>

<p>Magellan treated the man with kindness,
and soon other natives paid the
Spaniards visits. With them they appear
to have brought a couple of young
guanacos, leashed together and led by a
cord. They stated that they kept these
animals as decoys for the wild herds,
who on approaching the tethered guanacos
fell an easy prey to the hunters
lying in ambush close at hand.</p>

<p>The Patagonians are said to have
eaten rats, caught on the ship, whole,
without even removing the skins! However,
they seem to have been peaceably
disposed towards the Spaniards, until
Magellan, being struck with their great
height, resolved to take home some
specimens of the race as curiosities for
the Emperor, and consequently he entrapped
two of the young men while on
board his vessel. Seeing, however, that
one of these Patagonians grieved for
his wife, Magellan sent a party ashore with a couple of the
natives to fetch the woman: but on the road one of the natives
was wounded, the result being that the whole tribe took to flight
after a slight skirmish with the Spaniards, one of whom died almost
instantly after being struck by an arrow. From this event it would
seem that the Patagonians of that period used poisoned arrows, as
do the Onas of Tierra del Fuego to-day. These people do not
employ vegetable poison, but leave their arrows in a putrid carcase
until they become infected.</p>

<p>The next navigator to visit the shores of Patagonia was Sir
Francis Drake in 1578. He also commanded a small squadron of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
five vessels, and, curiously enough, had to cope with a plot against
his life when in the same harbour of Port San Julian. The
story is well known. Mr. Thomas Doughty, the chief mutineer,
was given his choice of death, or of marooning, or to be taken
home for trial. He chose death, and was accordingly executed.
Drake speaks of the natives as being no taller than some
Englishmen.</p>

<p class="caption">LAKES AND THE DISTANT CORDILLERA (SHOWING SECOND DIVISION)</p>
</div>

<p>During the next hundred years various expeditions touched
upon the coasts, some captained by Englishmen, such as Narborough,
Byron, and Wallis. The two latter differ a good deal
from each other with regard to the stature of the Patagonians.
Byron mentions a chief 7 ft. high, and adds that few of the others
were shorter. Wallis, on the other hand, gives an average of from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
5 ft. 10 in. to 6 ft., the tallest man measured by him being 6 ft. 7 in.
At an earlier date than either of these a Jesuit named Falkner,
being in Patagonia, mentions a <i>cacique</i> some inches over 7 ft.</p>

<p>In 1783 the traveller Viedma penetrated into the interior
and discovered one link of the long chain of lakes lying under
the Andes, which still bears his name. He gave the people
an average of 6 ft. of stature. Some fifty years after this,
H.M.S. <i>Beagle</i>, with Darwin on board, touched at many points
of the coast, and short trips inland were undertaken. Darwin's
journals give the first detailed account of the country. He
agrees with Captain Fitzroy in describing the Patagonians as the
tallest of all peoples.</p>

<p>During the years 1869-70, Captain George Chaworth Musters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
of the Royal Navy, spent several months with the nomad Indians,
traversing a great distance in their company, and becoming
acquainted with many interesting facts concerning their habits
and customs. Since the publication of his book in 1871 practically
nothing exhaustive has been written about Southern Patagonia.
One or two travellers have given short accounts of visits there, but
the serious opening up of the country is due to the initiative and
energy of Dr. Francisco P. Moreno, whose first excursion to Patagonia
was made in 1873. In the following year he carried his
investigations as far south as the River Santa Cruz. In 1875 he
crossed from Buenos Aires to Lake Nahuel-Huapi and the Andean
Cordillera, between parallels 39° 30´ and 42°. In 1876 he visited
Chubut, and ascended the river Santa Cruz to its parent lake, which
he proved was not that discovered by Viedma in 1782, but another
lying farther south. To him is due the earliest suggestion of the
great system of lakes which are situated in the longitudinal
depression that runs parallel with the Cordillera.</p>

<p>Again, in 1879, Dr. Moreno crossed the country to the Cordillera
on parallel 44°. Up to that time surveying in those regions
was by no means exempt from danger, on account of the hostile
attitude of the tribes. The amount of valuable work done by Dr.
Moreno did not end with his personal expeditions. Each summer
of late years the Argentine and Chilian Boundary Commissions
have been surveying and opening up the country. First and last
Dr. Moreno must always be regarded as the great geographer of
Patagonia.</p>

<p>Among the gentlemen engaged on the boundary work I should
like to mention the Norwegian Herr Hans P. Waag, who, on
behalf of the Argentine Commission, penetrated from the Pacific
coast up the river De las Heras to Lake Buenos Aires, and from
thence overland to Trelew. It would be difficult to overpraise the
work of this traveller.</p>

<p>Others, who as pioneers, travellers, scientific men, or surveyors,
have taken a part in the good work of making the interior of
Patagonia known to the world are Baron Nordenskjöld, Mr.
Hatcher, and the members of the Chilian and Argentine Boundary
Commissions. I think that in any such list as the above mention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
should be made of those who first settle in a district, and who
realise in greater degree than even the pioneer explorers the difficulties
and drawbacks of a new country, and undoubtedly their
hardihood is of immense and enduring value. I would, therefore,
include the name of the Waldron family, who have taken a large
part in settling the
southern districts
of Patagonia and
also in the colonising
of Tierra del
Fuego.</p>

<p class="caption">A PATAGONIAN <i>ESTANCIA</i></p>
</div>

<p>With this brief
reference to the
more important
journeys hitherto
made in Southern
Patagonia, it may
be well to give here
some description of
the country as it appears to-day. There are upon the eastern
coasts some settlements, as I have mentioned, and also the Welsh
colonies of Trelew, Dawson, Gaimon, besides these a very small
and recent one exists at Colohaupi, near Lake Musters, and
another, The 16th October, far away in the Cordillera. This
last is the single settlement of any size south of parallel 40° in the
central interior.</p>

<p>A fringe of farms runs along the coast, and at the mouths of
the rivers are situated little frontier towns, such as San Julian,
Santa Cruz and Gallegos. Towards the south and along the
shores of the Strait the fringe of farms has grown broader and
the country is more generally settled, the Chilian town of Punta
Arenas being an important port. The few vast straggling farms
are given up chiefly to sheep-breeding, the main export being
wool. But cattle and horses are also raised in large numbers, for
the land has proved very suitable for pasturage. The farm
buildings vary, of course, in many ways: some are large and
comfortable homesteads, others mere squalid huts, but one and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
all are almost invariably roofed in with the universal galvanised
iron.</p>

<p>The Welsh colonists have introduced a good strain to the
growing population, and there are constant wholesome as well as
vicious importations. In a country where shepherding of one
sort or another is the chief
industry, it is inevitable that
some equivalent of the cowboy
of the North must be
developed. The Gaucho is
the Patagonian cowboy, and
he is manly and picturesque
enough to be very interesting.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a name="i_030" id="i_030"></a>
<img src="images/i_030.jpg" width="308" height="227" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ARGENTINE GAUCHO</p>
</div>

<p>The Gauchos are picturesque
both in their lives
and in their appearance: a
pair of moleskin trousers, long boots, and a handkerchief usually
of a red pattern, a slouch hat of black felt, and a gaudy poncho
serve them for apparel. The poncho, which is merely a rug with
a hole in the middle for the head, makes a comfortable great-coat
by day and a blanket by night.</p>

<p>A Gaucho may be sprung from any nation on earth. Even as
the shores of Patagonia are washed by the farthest tides of ocean,
so the same tides have borne to people her solitude a singular
horde of massed nationalities. But it is the man born in the
country of whatever stock who becomes the true Gaucho. Infancy
finds him in the saddle, and he grows there. Other men can
stick on a horse, but the Gaucho can ride. Living as they do,
they form a class alone. On horseback they are more than men;
on foot, I am half tempted to say, less, for they would rather
ride fifty miles than walk two. They are farm-hands, shepherds,
horse-breakers, occasionally good working vets, and when they
prosper they buy waggons and go into the carrying trade; in
fact, they form the foundation of Patagonian life.</p>

<p>The coast settlements are similar to such places all the world
over: storekeepers, men who run wine-shops, traders, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
usual sort of folk who form the bulk of dwellers on the edge of
civilisation.</p>

<p>In Patagonia it is not difficult to leave civilisation behind
you, for between lat. 43°
and 50° S. the interior,
save for a very few pioneers
and small tribes of wandering
Tehuelche Indians,
is at the present day unpeopled.
When the line of
the Cordillera is reached,
you come to a region absolutely
houseless, where no
human inhabitant is to be
found. Comparatively speaking,
but little animal life
flourishes under the unnumbered
snow peaks, and
in the unmeasured spaces
of virgin forest, which cover
those valleys and in many
places cloak the mountains
from base to shoulder.
Hundreds of square miles
of forest-land, gorges, open slopes, and terraced hollows lie lost in
the vast embrace of the Patagonian Andes, on which the eye of
man has never yet fallen.</p>

<p class="caption">HALF-BREED GAUCHO</p>
</div>

<p>Our travels took us over a great part of the country. Starting
in September 1900, we zigzagged from Trelew by Bahia
Camerones, to Lakes Colhué and Musters and along the River
Senguerr to Lake Buenos Aires. After spending a time in the
neighbourhood of that lake, we followed the Indian trail for some
distance, then touching the Southern Chico we reached Santa
Cruz on the east coast in January 1901. Leaving most of the
expedition there, I returned with two companions by the course of
the River Santa Cruz to the Cordillera, where I remained for
some months, and in May I once more crossed the continent to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Gallegos to take ship for Punta Arenas, the only port in Patagonia
where a steamer calls regularly. I left Patagonia in June 1901.
I compute that the whole distance covered by the journeyings of
the expedition cannot have fallen short of 2000 miles.</p>

<p>Of the zoology of Patagonia little is known. Of the fauna and
flora of the Cordillera of the southern central part it is not too
much to say that practically nothing is known. Patagonia thus
offers one of the most interesting fields in the world to the traveller
and naturalist.</p>

<p>With these preliminary remarks, I will beg the reader to
embark with me upon the Argentine National transport the
<i>Primero de Mayo</i>, bound from the port of Buenos Aires for the
south.

<p>We arrived at Buenos Aires early in September 1900, and on the
10th we embarked again on board the <i>Primero de Mayo</i>, one of
the transports of the Argentine Government, by which my companions
and myself had courteously been granted passages to
Patagonia. The <i>Primero de Mayo</i> is a boat of 650 tons. We
carried an extraordinary amount of deck cargo, for there were
a good many passengers on board, as these transports offered
the sole means existing at that time<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of communication by sea
with Argentine Patagonia.</p>

<p>We started about one o'clock. Lieutenant Jurgensen, the
<i>commandante</i>, was good enough to invite us to dine on that night
with the officers in the deck-house. He subsequently extended
his invitation to cover the entire voyage. After dinner we went
out upon the deck. It was starlight, and the <i>Primero de Mayo</i>
was steaming down the brown estuary of the Plata.</p>

<p>First night out! What a penance it is! It is "good-bye"
translated into heaviness of heart, and it knows for the time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
no future and no hope. You can only look back miserably and
long for lost companionship and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>All dear scenes to which the soul</p>
<p>Turns, as the lodestone seeks the pole.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is a time when romance fades out, and nothing is left save the
grey fact of recent partings and the misery of unaccustomed
quarters.</p>

<p>First night out&mdash;when one renews acquaintance with the
thin cold sheets and those extraordinary coverlets whose
single habitat in the world appears to be upon the bunks of
steamers. Our fellow passengers also seemed very much under
the same influence of greyness. They had packed themselves
round the saloon-table, and were keeping the stewards busy with
orders.</p>

<p>There were not only a good many people, but peoples, on
board; all nations in ragged ponchos with round fur caps or those
pointed sombreros that one associates with pictures of elves in a
wood. As wild-looking a crew were gathered for'ard as ever
sailed Southward Ho! Germans, Danes, Poles, and heaven knows
what other races besides; each little party formed laagers of their
possessions and resented intrusion with volley-firing of oaths.
There was one laager in which I found myself taking a particular
interest; it was made up of two men, a woman, and her brood of
children. Their only belongings appeared to consist of four
ponchos, a <i>maté</i> pot and kettle, and a huge basket of cauliflowers.
They crept in and entrenched themselves between the cauliflowers
and the port bulwark in the waist of the ship. From there they
did not move, but sat swaying their bodies during the entire
voyage. Was Patagonia an Eldorado to which those people were
journeying? On that dark night, as the ship slid groaning and
creaking over the brown waters, the dark scene, lit by stray blurs of
light, called up a memory of Leighton's picture, "The Sea shall
give up its Dead."</p>

<p>Among the passengers was the Governor of Santa Cruz, Señor
Don Matias McKinlay Tapiola, who speaks English very well.
There were also one or two gentlemen interested in sheep-farming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
in Patagonia. Of these, Mr. Greenshields, whose <i>estancia</i> or farm
we visited later, owned the credit of having broken new ground in
colonising a part of the country some one hundred and fifty miles
south of the Welsh settlement of Trelew. The earlier sheep-farms
lay about Punta Arenas, eight degrees to the southward,
and there the men of the south
swore by the south, and much
difference of opinion existed as
to how sheep would flourish in
the more northerly region chosen
by Mr. Greenshields. But it
seemed that his daring was likely
to be richly repaid, and that
many, when they heard of his success,
would follow his example.</p>

<p class="caption">J. B. SCRIVENOR</p>
</div>

<p>At length it was bedtime,
and we turned in with the comforting
reflection that when we
woke "first night out" would be
over.</p>

<p>Next morning land had sunk
from sight and there was a light
ground-swell, but the <i>Primero de Mayo</i> was rolling heavily, a trick
that Government transports possess and seem to regard in the light
of a privilege all the world over. The evenings and the mornings
followed each other in grey but serene regularity, till on the 12th
we turned coastwards, heading for Puerto Belgrano, and ran
between low, green, hummocky banks up a stretch of shallow,
mud-coloured water to our anchorage. It was a reddish sunset
with lightning playing continuously upon the horizon, and while we
were at dinner a thunderstorm broke with heavy rain. That night
we were permitted the privilege and amusement of choosing the
morrow's <i>menu</i>. We chose a truly British repast; roast beef, jam-roll
and plum-pudding figuring amongst the items. There are no
employments too trifling to help one to pass the time on board a
ship doing service as a coaster. As to the arrangements made for
our well-being on the transport, the Minister of Marine had, I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
informed, kindly given most generous orders with regard to our
treatment.</p>

<p>In the morning we disembarked forty-two sailors for the four men-of-war
lying at anchor in the bay. Then we sailed away again for
the south with a warm sun upon the crowded planking and a cold
wind blowing aft. It was at this time that I altered my original
plans and decided on landing at Puerto Madryn, our next stopping-place,
instead of at Santa Cruz, which lies some seven degrees of
latitude farther to the south. Upon hearing that winter had not
yet relaxed its grip on the country south, it became clear that
the horses down there would be thin and in poor condition, with
the spring sickness upon them, and therefore quite unfitted to
start upon such a journey as lay before us. The new scheme also
promised a saving of time, as the <i>Primero de Mayo</i>, owing to the
necessity of calling at various little places on the way down to
Santa Cruz, would be a good deal delayed; besides, the horses we
required could probably be got together more quickly at Puerto
Madryn.</p>

<p>We had a number of Welsh with us on the transport, who were
on their way home to the Welsh settlements of Trelew, Gaiman
and Rawson. In the evenings of the voyage it was their custom
to forgather and sing psalms in Welsh, psalms the sound of which
took one's memory back to the Scottish hills and the yearly ante-communion
preachings in the open-air. The surrounding greyness
aided the idea&mdash;grey sea, grey sky, grey weather.</p>

<p>By the way, on board we learnt a fact, or so we were assured
it was, about the South African War, which is certainly not well
known even among those who love the Boer. One night at table,
one of the diners solemnly declared that at Mafeking the English
ate the flesh of the Kaffirs and were thereby enabled to hold out
for so long. He was not attempting to hoax us, he really believed
the fable himself, poor fellow! I did not gather the gentleman's
name.</p>

<p>Coming on deck on the morning of the 15th, we saw, drawn
across the western sea-rim, a low brown line. Above it a sky of
steel-blue gleamed coldly and below a wash of grey sea. This was
our first view of Patagonia. All day we crept along the grim,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
quiet, solitary-looking cliff, until at last the <i>Primero de Mayo</i> was
swallowed up in the vast embrace of the Golfo Nuevo. It was
between evening and night when we approached our harbourage,
Puerto Madryn. The half-lights were playing above it, and the
afterglow of the sunset still shone feebly behind the land. We
saw only raw cliff capped by dark verdure&mdash;the rim of the vast
pampas which roll away in rising levels league upon league
towards the Andes.</p>

<p>The sea was cold, the wind was cold, the land looked forlorn
and a-cold. Presently from it a little boat put out containing a
figure wrapped in a long military cloak. This was the sub-prefect,
who thus welcomed us to these desolate shores, for
Patagonia from the sea is a desolate prospect indeed. It would be
difficult to give an adequate idea of the dismal aspect presented by
Puerto Madryn upon that evening. Suffice it to say that the
settlement consists of half a dozen houses and a flagstaff; the
first crouch on the lip of the tide and the second shivers above on
the bare pampa-rim.</p>

<p>There seals and divers haunt the sea, a few guanaco-herds live
upon the coast-lands, and there, in inhospitable fashion, the little
colony of human beings clings, as it were, upon the skirts of great
primordial nature. In the evening lights the cliffs showed curiously
pallid above a strip of dead sand and shingle, only the sky and the
water seemed alive.</p>

<p>Next morning we hoped to get our baggage ashore and were
moving early with that object in view. But the trend of public
opinion in Puerto Madryn appears to be towards the conviction
that there is no sort of reason for hurry under any circumstances.
Hence the cargo disgorged itself slowly, and after interminable
waiting we found our particular share of it would not be reached
that night. It was, in fact, not till the afternoon of the second day
that we achieved a partial recovery of our belongings from the
holds and took the first consignment of it ashore. The morning
had broken clear and fine, but mid-day brought a change. And
by the time we had our boatload completed and rocketed away
shorewards at the tail of the <i>Primero de Mayo's</i> steam-launch, a
beam sea was flying in spray high over us.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>There was an anxious moment when the launch slipped the
towing-cable and the sailor in the bows flung a rope, which
dropped short of the black wooden jetty, and we were swept some
boat-lengths away by a big broken sea. To be swamped at the
moment of landing!&mdash;the
thought was too
disastrous to be dwelt
on; half our rifles and a
box of instruments were
on board. It cost us a
long hour and a half of
hard work before everything
was safe ashore.
And while we toiled a
dozen seals came and
stared at us with their
doglike faces, and lazy,
solemn eyes.</p>

<p>When all our property
had been brought
to land, luckily without
mishaps of any kind, I
left Scrivenor with our
<i>peones</i> to bring up the
heavy baggage and went
on with Burbury to Trelew by the miniature train which plies to
and fro between the Welsh colony and the coast. From Trelew
a ten-days ride takes you beyond the farm of the last settler and
into the waste places of the pampas.</p>

<p>Trelew is a new and pocket Wales, but very much Wales
all the same. To prove the accuracy of this statement it is only
necessary to say that the waggon which set us on the first leagues of
our way belonged to a Jones, that another Jones accompanied the
expedition to the Cordillera, that I negotiated with a third Jones
for a supply of mutton to take with us for use on the first part of
our journey, that I was introduced to several Williamses and did
business with various Hugheses. And all this in a day and a half.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>Trelew itself is a bare settlement of raw-looking houses and
shanties, which has started up on the emptiness of the pampas. It
cannot lay any claim to picturesqueness, and a pervading impression
of being unfinished adds a suggestion of discomfort to
the place. All round about the mud houses the pampa rolls
away to the distances,
harsh, stony,
overgrown with little
humpy bushes of
thorn and dotted
here and there with
wheat-land. All
through and over the
settlement you are
never out of hearing
of three languages&mdash;English,
Welsh and
Spanish.</p>

<p class="caption">WELSH SETTLEMENT OF TRELEW</p>
</div>

<p>For thirty-five
years the Welsh have lived in this little colony of their own
founding. Exactly all the reasons which led them to forsake their
far-off homes for Patagonia it would serve no purpose to set out
in detail, but the root of the matter appears to have lain in
the fact that they objected to the laws relating to the teaching of
English in the schools; and, having the courage of their convictions,
they came several thousand miles across the sea to escape
the <i>régime</i> they disliked. At present, however, they seem to have
slipped from the frying-pan into the fire, for they like still less the
Argentine code, by which every man born in the Republic is subject
to conscription and Sunday drilling.</p>

<p>Some time ago the colonists of Trelew appealed to England
to intercede for them with the Argentine Government with a view
to obtaining release from these disabilities. But as the Welsh had
of their own free will deliberately placed themselves under the
Government of the Republic, it was impossible for England to
interfere, and this fact was notified to the suppliants, much to
their disappointment and disgust. Even when I was there they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
remained rather sore over the matter, complaining that England
had taken all the money subscribed for the expenses of the appeal
and given them no redress in return.</p>

<p>The difficulties and hardships which must inevitably have beset
the commencement of their settling in Patagonia, contrasted with
their present condition, show the Welsh to be splendid people. The
resolute spirit that drove them to emigrate across the seas has
served to make their township there, though perhaps not particularly
inviting to look at, a flourishing one in its quiet pastoral way.
They have laid a railway, as has been said, to the coast at Puerto
Madryn and established a telephone. Spanish and Welsh live here
as neighbours. The Spaniard keeps the store while the Welshman
farms, growing a certain amount of grain, but his chief business
lies in breeding horses, cattle and sheep.</p>

<p>The Welshmen are not wanting in keen business quality.
Any one who has tried to buy horses in Trelew will bear me out
in this statement. The mere fact that a stranger has arrived in
their colony, who wants to invest in horseflesh, awakens all their
commercial instincts, and they are not at all behind the rest of the
world in knowing how to form a combine for the purpose of
plundering the Philistines. Quite right too. A man who can
resist making a bargain over a horse whenever he gets the chance
is, like "the good young man who died," over-perfect for this
corrupt old world.</p>

<p>From their first settlement the Welsh have spread south
through the coast-towns of Patagonia, and six weeks' journey from
Trelew they have formed another settlement in the Cordilleras to
the north-west which they have called the "16th October Colony."
Thither waggons are always trekking, and waggon-drivers and
others who return bring with them glowing and rosy descriptions
of the young settlement of the interior. The adaptability of the
Welsh to the peculiar needs of colonisation is very remarkable.
They have certainly stepped into the "larger life" with success.</p>

<p class="caption">OUTFITTING IN A PATAGONIAN STORE</p>
</div>

<p>The influence of the new conditions of existence, so different
from that of the Welsh peasant in his own country, is very noticeable
in several ways. The older and the younger generation are
unlike each other now, and will probably continue to become more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
so as time goes on. Physically the younger people are far better
developed than their elders, red-faced, open-eyed, straight-backed
boys in big felt hats, each with a bright-coloured handkerchief
knotted round his neck
and the guanaco-wool poncho
hanging from his shoulders.
They are very picturesque and
look their best on horseback.
In this matter of riding also
there is a wide difference between
the styles of the old and
the young men. The latter, who
are Patagonian born, seem to be
part of their horses, but the
elders, however excellent long
practice has made them, never
attain to the proficiency of their
sons.</p>

<p class="caption">HUMPHREY JONES, JUN.</p>
</div>

<p>Although the colony of
Trelew is to-day in a more or
less flourishing condition and
very Welsh, a grave danger menaces it. In fifty years time
how will it be with the racial element? Will there be as many
Welsh then as now? I fear not, and the result is difficult to
foresee. The danger takes the form of the dark-eyed Argentine
maiden, who is rather apt to "make roast meat of the heart"
of the Welsh youth. While the Welsh girls do not take very
readily to Spanish-speaking husbands, the Welsh boys fall very
much in love with the daughters of the South. So it is to be
concluded that the language difficulty will settle itself, or, at any
rate, become more easy of arrangement with each succeeding
generation. If the girl you love speaks only Spanish, it is quite
obvious you must learn Spanish in order to be able to talk to her,
and, under the circumstances, you will not find the task a very
hard one. Then children nearly always show a preference for the
mother's tongue and speech in contradistinction to that of the
father. Probably, if these prophecies were uttered in Trelew, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
men of to-day would scoff at them. But onlookers often see most
of the game. In 1865 the Welsh, in deep sorrow, left their own
land to escape the tyranny of the English law, as they considered
it, which sought to force upon them the English language. Their
desire was to preserve their own tongue. And flying from Scylla
they will fall (and to some degree have already fallen) a prey to
Charybdis. But it is a very pleasant Charybdis, typified by a
dark-haired, dark-eyed, lissom maiden, who will bear them sons
no longer of the old pure-bred Welsh stock, but of a mixed race.
And so the effort of the forefathers, who fared overseas to found a
new home, shall be made null and void.</p>

<p>Now and again it is the fate of frontier towns to be stirred to
their depths by some incursion from the old world they have left
behind them. Trelew was still recovering from such an experience
when we arrived there. The settlement, in short, had been suffering
from a plague of lords. First appeared an aristocrat, who
wished to travel in the interior, and he bought up horses with a
lavish hand, and generally made preparations which, no doubt,
filled the purses of the inhabitants. This gentleman's projected
tour, however, fell through for some reason, and he departed
whence he had come into the unknown world outside of Trelew's
daily cognisance.</p>

<p>Presently after him followed a second "lord," who gave his
name as Lord Reed, and who was received with open arms by
an enthusiastic community. A run of lords appeared to be setting
in, and was regarded by the Trelewians as a distinct dispensation
in their favour, which it was their happy duty to work out thoroughly
to their own advantage. By some mistake Lord Reed had left
his ready money behind him, and, therefore, borrowed pretty
extensively from the kind-hearted Welshmen. After a time Lord
Reed vanished, and upon inquiry being made it was discovered
that no such title as Lord Reed was to be found in the Peerage of
Great Britain. When this fact became established, more than one
Welshman is reported to have gone out after Lord Reed with the
family gun, and, I believe, he was finally caught with a lasso! But
the incident was not without its bearing on our personal affair, for
the Bank of Trelew would have nothing whatever to say to my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
Cook's letter of credit. In vain I recited my credentials, and gave
such proof of genuineness as was in my power to give. They
would none of me. The bank evidently argued that it was easier
to pretend that you were a <i>bona-fide</i> traveller than that you were
a lord. Lord Reed too; it was rather a taking title. I could not
at first understand where the humour of the question, put to me
by several people I met in Trelew, of "Are you not Lord
Prichard?" came in. In fact, it was disconcerting; but later on,
when I heard the above story, I did not grudge the colonists any
fun that might be got out of the situation, for certainly Lord Reed,
taken all in all, had been far from a subject of pure amusement to
them.</p>

<p>We remained six days at Trelew making those last few
purchases which were necessary with the small stock of extra
money that I had left myself as a margin. It was directly owing
to Lord Reed that I finally set forth into the interior with but thirty
dollars in Argentine notes and large drafts on Cook and Son, which
were quite useless. Although the wilderness does not seem a
likely field for spending money, yet, before our travels were at an
end, I was glad to sell horses to supply the needs of our party.</p>

<p>The journey which lay before us to Lake Buenos Aires was about
six hundred miles in length, and this distance might be subdivided
into three stages: the first, from Trelew to Bahia Camerones,
where the expedition became complete; the second, from Bahia
Camerones to the Lakes Musters and Colhué; and the third,
to Lake Buenos Aires itself. My instructions gave me an entirely
free hand, within reasonable limits, as to the number of men I
might take with me.</p>

<p>I had from the first been convinced that the smallest number
possible would also be, in our case, the wisest. The immense
extent of the country to be traversed, and the difficulties which
must inevitably lie in our way to hinder and delay us, as well as
the practical emptiness of the country, which requires that an
expedition shall be self-supporting, were salient facts; and our
plans had to be made and modified in relation to these facts. The
mobility of the party was the main point to aim at. Hence it was
necessary to cut down the <i>personnel</i> of the expedition to as low a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
number as possible, and it was further most important to have
plenty of horses and to spare.</p>

<p>The difficulty of feeding several men when travelling through
such a country was obvious, and therefore not to be thought of,
as, besides the four horses each individual needed for riding,
the extra animals for carrying provision and bedding, clothing,
tents, &amp;c. had to be taken into account. No pack-horse should be
allowed to carry his load two days consecutively, and, in fact, one
day's work in three is enough. If waggons are taken, each should
be allowed three teams of six horses each.</p>

<p>With such ideas in view, those arrangements were made which,
in fact, enabled us to cover the distances we achieved. Any
expedition of this sort is killing work for the horses, and it stands
greatly to Burbury's credit that we lost but one out of nearly sixty
during the months we spent in Patagonia, and that one was a colt
that died of eating poison-shrub.</p>

<p>There is not the slightest doubt that the policy that spells
success in Patagonian travel is summed up in the words, "Cut
down your men and your stores, and take enough horses to enable
you to move lightly and rapidly."</p>

<p>On September 21 we left Trelew in the afternoon. The
weather was magnificent. Our caravan at this period consisted
of a couple of waggons as well as the horses. Two
<i>estancieros</i>, Messrs. Greenshields and Haddock, accompanied us,
as our way led past their farms. I sent the waggons ahead
and rode on afterwards with Burbury and Humphrey Jones
senior. When we came to the place fixed on for our first camp
we found the men had gone on, for there was no water there. We
pushed forward in the dark, and presently the fire of the encampment
glimmered out in front of us; it seemed to be quite near,
but it took a good while to reach. We heard an occasional fox,
and as we sat round the fire a few birds passed in the dark, calling.
The first night in camp is like the first night at sea, a gloomy
time.</p>

</div>

<p>The next day we again had a bright sun with a strong west
wind. We chased some pampa foxes and an ostrich (<i>Rhea
darwini</i>) and killed two of the former. Jones and Burbury caught
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
a cavy (<i>Dolichotis patagonica</i>). So we marched on over the
rolling downs day after day, sometimes catching a glimpse of
the sea, sometimes journeying across pampas where the far
horizons met in pale blue sky and puffed white clouds above,
and below grass and
endless scrub. We
saw Cayenne plover
(<i>Vanellus cayennensis</i>)
at an early stage of
our travels.</p>

<img src="images/i_049.jpg" width="484" height="361" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE START OF OUR LONG TREK</p>
</div>

<p>I have already
mentioned the herds
of guanaco that roam
the interior. This
animal belongs distinctively
to South
America, and is to be
found nowhere else in
the world. Darwin writes of it as follows: "The guanaco, or
wild llama, is the characteristic quadruped of the plains of Patagonia....
It is an elegant animal in a state of nature, with a
long slender neck and fine legs." In colour the guanaco is of a
golden-brown with white underparts, the hair upon the sides being
somewhat long and fleecy. Enormous herds of from three to five
hundred live upon the pampas, and we were aware that we should
chiefly depend for meat on those we might chance to shoot during
many months to come.</p>

<p>One evening, when I was riding ahead with the troop of horses,
I saw my first guanaco. Coming round a bend of the winding
<i>cañadon</i>, I looked up and perceived him. The sight was highly
picturesque. It was an old buck standing alone on the top of a
cliff some two hundred feet high and looking down at me. He
was posed against a background of pale green glinting sunset. I
had hardly time to unsling my rifle before he bounded away. We
saw many thousands afterwards, but somehow in the nature of
things I shall never forget that first one.</p>

<p>On the coast-farms, which, it must be recollected, are many of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
them scores of square leagues in extent, the guanaco grows comparatively
tame, becoming used to the passing of mounted
shepherds; but in other parts of Patagonia, noticeably in the
valley of the River Chico of Chubut, through which we passed
later, they are very wild, allowing no human being to approach
within half a mile. This is owing to the Indians, who hunt them
perpetually in that district.</p>

<p>Once in camp in Patagonia life is very enjoyable, though
perhaps the enjoyment varies with the amount of game to be seen.
Up at sunrise, when the sun pokes its big bald lemon-coloured
head out of the bed-clothes of the sky. Then some early camp-man
stirs and rises, and waddles down to the wet grey ashes of
yesternight's fire, and soon a weak trail of smoke goes rocketing
away in the wind. The big pot is put on and breakfast is made
and eaten. Then the cargo is packed, and the horses are rounded
up by a Gaucho or two, riding bareback. We saddle up and the
caravan moves off on its leagues-long march.</p>

<p>Marches vary from fifteen miles to forty, and when the afternoon
sun waxes less strong the horses are off-saddled and turned
loose, the waggons unpacked and the camp-fires lighted. <i>Maté</i>
eternally, a roast, tea afterwards and a pipe, and then the sleeping-bags.
<i>Maté</i> or <i>yerba</i>, I must explain, is the great drink of the
pampas, and is most invigorating. A cup or tin is half filled with
the yellow powdery leaves, to which is added a little cold water,
followed by hot. It is drunk through a <i>bombilla</i> or tube, the maker
of the decoction taking the first pull, and afterwards it passes from
hand to hand, and I must add from mouth to mouth, round the
circle. It is the greatest insult to refuse to partake, and when the
originator of the brew happens to be an old and rather unappetising
Tehuelche lady, the effort to take your turn and look pleased is
often something of an ordeal.</p>

<p>Day after day went by in much the same manner, but few remembrances
remain with me more vividly than the pampa fox and cavy
hunting which we enjoyed during those early times of our expedition.
Four lurchers of sorts and my big greyhound, Tom, trotted
behind our horses, and when game was sighted we went after it at
full gallop. In that keen air nothing can be more exhilarating than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
such a chase over the broken ground of the pampa, where we were
often successful, but among hummocks and hills the quarry
frequently made good its escape.</p>

<p class="caption">MR. LANGLEY'S <i>ESTANCIA</i> ON THE ROAD TO BAHIA CAMERONES</p>
</div>

<p>On the 25th we passed a farm that was quite English in appearance&mdash;wire-fences
enclosing sheep and lambs
on downs that descended
in undulations to the
sea. By evening we
were in broken country
patched with red rock.
The horses were rather
troublesome; Hughes,
one of the Gauchos,
rode an untamed mare
and gave a good exhibition
of horsemanship.
Among the sheep and
the hills an Indian rode down from the high ground; he wore
a poncho of red and black, tinted like autumn trees. His camp
consisted of a little fire of three or four sticks, by which squatted
his <i>china</i>. He took his place beside her, and watched our line of
waggons and horses wind away out of sight.</p>

<p>From Trelew to Camerones the country was for the most part
like the bare deer-forests of the Scottish Highlands, brown bracken
being replaced by <i>espinilla</i> (thorn, a general term) and the green
shrub called by the Welshmen "poison-bush," the same blue sky
above, the same occasional lochlike lagoons. For the first two
days or more the pampas stretched to the rim of the horizon,
empty and somewhat harsh even in the sunlight. Now and then
mirages like squadrons of cavalry hovered along the edges of them.
A few guanaco and ostriches, a sprinkling of cavy, and many
pampa foxes seemed to eke out an existence there. It was a land
of vast prospects, a scene laid forth with a sort of noble parsimony,
which&mdash;as in the case of a miser so miserly that for the very
exceedingness of his vice you respect him&mdash;was yet stupendous in
its one or two grandly simple salient features, and drove the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
spectator to that admiration which verges upon fear. Picture one
such characteristic vision of Patagonia. As far as eye could reach
a spread of wind-weary grass, roofed by a wind-blown sky, an
eagle poised far off, a dot in the upper air. Nothing more.</p>

<p>A man alone within this vast setting seemed puny. Lost here,
without a horse, he would be the most helpless of things created. It
was across this gigantic primordialism that our way led us. Three
times we made our camp upon the bare pampas, three times in one
or other of the many <i>cañadones</i> before reaching Bahia Camerones.
You may be voyaging at an easy jog over the pampa, seeing the
land roll apparently quite level to the horizon, when suddenly you
come upon a spatter of white sand, a track leading between the
shoulders of the pampa, you dive down and are lost to sight in
a moment; then, perhaps, for four miles or for fourteen you are
riding a couple of hundred feet below the level spread of the
pampa, and as you pass the guanaco on the cliff tops watch you uneasily.
To be lost in such a land is the simplest possible matter.</p>

<p>On the 27th we arrived at the Estancia Lochiel, where Mr.
Greenshields most kindly entertained us. This <i>estancia</i> is situated
at the head of a <i>cañadon</i>, which drops away to the sea eight
leagues distant. It consists of a small colony of wooden houses
with corrugated iron roofs. The Lochiel Sheep Farming Company,
of which Mr. Greenshields is manager, have 15,000 sheep and
forty square leagues of camp. "Camp," you must understand,
in Patagonia means land.</p>

<p>The day after our arrival Scrivenor and Burbury accompanied
Mr. Frederick Haddock to his farm, eight leagues away, in order
to bring back the horses I had purchased by contract in Trelew.
I remained behind as Mr. Greenshields' guest, for a puma was
reported by the shepherd to have killed five sheep upon the edge
of the farm during the previous night.</p>

<p>Macdonald, the Scotch shepherd, Barckhausen and I set out
to see if we could find the puma. On my way to the spot I
shot my first guanaco. He appeared upon the skyline doing
sentinel, possibly against the very puma we were after. We
rode under the hill on which the guanaco was watching, and
he began to move uneasily. At the bend of the hill was a small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
hollow, and, as we rode through this, I told my companions to
ride on and threw them my <i>cabresto</i> (leading-rope of a horse). I
slid off the horse and crawled up the hill. Upon the bare face of
it was a thicket of poison-bush, and into this I ultimately made my
way. The sentinel guanaco was there above me, stretching out
his long neck, and every now and
then giving his high neighing
laugh. When one hundred and
twenty yards off he saw me, and
I had to snap him quickly. Swing
went his neck, and away he galloped
with his swift, uneven gait.
I thought I had missed him,
when, to my delight, he began
to slacken speed, and finally lay
down in an ungainly attitude, his
long neck crooked in a curve in
front of him. I crawled nearer,
and up he got and was off again.
I ran down to my horse and
mounted, and Macdonald let Tom, my hound, loose. We galloped
the guanaco up. He was very sick indeed, and inside of three
hundred yards Tom pulled him down again. The Mauser bullet
had hit him two inches behind the shoulder about half way down
the body. It had not come out. How he managed to get so
far I cannot understand. We then went onwards, and saw by the
way several herds of guanaco. I did not shoot any more,
however, as they were uncommonly tame, and there was, of
course, mutton at the <i>estancia</i>. We reached the spot on the
hills above the puma's kill, low thorn bushes, vast mountain and
blue sea, but no sign of the puma was to be found. These
animals will often travel four or five leagues after a kill.</p>

<p>By the way, when you fire at a guanaco they will sway their
heads downwards with an odd sort of ducking motion. Not one
individual but a whole herd will do this at any unaccustomed
sound. The effect is most curious.</p>

<p>While at Bahia Camerones our party was completed. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
took with us five Gauchos, who are active, handy men as a rule.
The population of the country is largely composed of Gauchos;
in fact, they form the foundation of Patagonian life.</p>

<p>They live by the horse, and the horse lives by them. They
drive mobs of cattle or of horses for owners across three degrees
of latitude to sell them. They have been born in the camp, live
in the camp, and will very likely die there also. In Patagonia
they treat their horses in a method very different to that which we
employ in our crowded country. There nature gives grass, water,
and the horse; man tames the animal as little as possible from his
wild state, and forces an alliance with nature. At night the mares
are hobbled and the horses turned loose; while the Gauchos light
their camp-fire and drink <i>maté</i> through the <i>bombilla</i>.</p>

<p>At the first light next morning they take it in turn to bring in
the troop, which they do with an astonishing swiftness. Sometimes,
of course, the horses "clear," and then it is that the Gauchos
in charge find them by tracking.</p>

<p>In a country intersected by deep <i>cañadones</i>, which offer a secure
hiding-place in their many hollows, this is a difficult matter. The
tracks perhaps run easily through a belt of soft marsh, and then
are invisible upon a pampa of shingle and thorn.</p>

<p>A true Gaucho must be able to do a number of things&mdash;to back
an untamed colt, to lassoo, to use the <i>boleadores</i>, which are heavy
stones attached together by a hide rope, and are to the Patagonian
what the boomerang is to the Australian aborigine. He must be
able to cook, to make horse-gear from the pelts of beasts, to find
his way without a compass from point to point, by instinct as it
were.</p>

<p>The Gaucho shares with the poet the honour of being born,
not made. This proves that Gaucho work is Art, with a big A.
Take, for instance, the power of driving single-handed a big mob
of wild horses and keeping them compact. No one who has not
tried it can imagine what heartbreaking work it is to a beginner.
One learns to do it after a fashion in time, but never like the man
who has been bred to the craft.

</p>

<p>I will not bore my readers with all the technicalities of our
preparations for the real start.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that our total belongings were stowed upon a
waggon and on the backs of four pack-horses. We had in all
sixty horses, and eight men. About forty of these horses had
been running wild upon the pampa for eight months previous to
our acquiring them. During that time they had been lost and had
only been recaptured shortly before our arrival in Trelew. The
purchase of them was, however, the best speculation I could
make under the circumstances, since all the animals were good and
sound. Had I bought by small instalments in Trelew, not only
would every man within journeying distance have very naturally
attempted to palm off upon me the worst and most vicious animals
he possessed, but the horses, not being used to one another's
company, would have been impossible to keep together at night
upon the pampas, as the various sections composing such a <i>tropilla</i>
would inevitably have scattered to the four points of the compass.</p>

<p>Patagonian horses, which are descended from those brought
over by the Spaniards in the sixteenth century, are never stabled,
but are turned out rain and snow in their troops. These troops
or <i>tropillas</i> consist of any number from six animals to thirty, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
to each is assigned a <i>madrina</i>, or bell-mare, which is never ridden,
and which is trained to be caught easily. At night she is hobbled,
and her troop remain round about her. Naturally a well-trained
<i>madrina</i> is one affair, while a badly-trained one is quite another.
In my mob of horses I had four troops, two good madrinas and
one bad one, while the fourth was a <i>rosada</i>, whose sole object in
life seemed to be to get away from her own troop and to kick any
one who came within ten feet of her.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_056" id="i_056"></a>
<img src="images/i_056.jpg" width="550" height="378" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A PAMPA ROUND-UP</p>
</div>

<p>When you desire to put a strange horse or colt into a troop,
it is necessary to couple him to the <i>madrina</i> for some days, after
which he will remain with the troop. The <i>madrina</i> should never
be driven in hobbles, a mistake that is often made when bringing
in the horses of a morning. A horse used to hobbles can travel
in them four or five leagues in a single night, so the reason why
the mares should not be allowed ever to become used to travelling
in hobbles is obvious. The <i>madrina</i> has a bell attached to her
neck, and the last sound heard before you sleep is the soft tinkle
of these bells and the comfortable sound of feeding horses, unless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
the troop happens to take it into their head to make off, in which
case you will have a long ride upon their tracks in the morning.</p>

<p>The horses throughout the Argentine Republic are known by
their colours (for which the Spanish language supplies an extraordinary
variety of terms signifying every tint and shade), and to
these names they answer. Some of the names are melodious and
pretty&mdash;<i>alazan</i>, which means chestnut, <i>cruzado</i>, the name given to
a horse that possesses alternate white feet, the off fore and the near
hind foot, or the other way round. There is a theory among the
Gauchos that a <i>cruzado</i> will never tire. I cannot do better than
give a list of the names of the horses of my own <i>tropilla</i>, though,
of course, there are many others:</p>

<ul class="none">
<li><i>Alazan</i>, chestnut.</li>

<li><i>Asulejo</i>, bluish-grey and
white in patches.</li>

<li><i>Bayo</i>, fawn.</li>

<li><i>Blanco</i>, white.</li>

<li><i>Cruzado</i>, with crossed white
feet.</li>

<li><i>Gateado</i>, yellow with black
stripe down back.</li>

<li><i>Horqueta</i>, slit-eared.</li>

<li><i>Moro</i>, grey.</li>

<li><i>Oscuro</i>, black.</li>

<li><i>Overo</i>, piebald or skewbald.</li>

<li><i>Pangaré</i>, brown or bay with
fawn muzzle.</li>

<li><i>Picaso</i>, black with white
blaze and white legs.</li>

<li><i>Rosado</i>, red and white in
patches, roan.</li>

<li><i>Rosillo</i>, strawberry.</li>

<li><i>Tordillo</i>, grey.</li>

<li><i>Tostado</i>, toast-coloured.</li>

<li><i>Zaino</i>, brown or dark bay.</li>
</ul>

<p>The taming of these horses is a business of which an account
may not be uninteresting. The methods used are of a very rough
description. The colt is caught from the <i>manada</i>, or troop of
mares in which he was born, with a lasso, a head-stall is put on
him and he is tied up to the <i>palenque</i>, or centre-post of the corral.
Here he is left for twelve hours or so, during which he generally
expends his energies in trying to pull the <i>palenque</i> out of the
ground. He is then saddled up, generally with an accompaniment
of bucking, and the Gaucho who is to tame him climbs upon his
back. Another mounted Gaucho is near by to "ride off," which
he does by galloping between the colt and any dangerous ground
or object. Probably the colt will begin by bucking, but if he does
not do so during his first gallop it by no means follows that he will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
turn out to be free from the fault. Indeed it is quite probable that
he may be soft and fat after his easy youth upon the pampas, and
not till about the fifth or sixth gallop will he show such vices as are
in him. At first he is ridden on the <i>bocado</i>, which is a soft strip
of hide tied round the lower jaw. This answers to the heavy
snaffle which is the first bit a colt has to submit to in England.</p>

<p>The Gauchos of Patagonia are not nearly patient enough with
the mouths of their mounts, spoiling many by harsh treatment.
Different colours in horses are supposed to indicate different temperaments;
thus they say a <i>Moro</i> colt is generally docile, while a
<i>Picaso</i> has the reputation of being very much the reverse.</p>

<p>The horses of Northern Patagonia&mdash;such as were ours, for they
came from the banks of the Rio Negro&mdash;are reputed to be more
spirited than those bred in the south. But this theory is possibly
owing to the fact that the average Gaucho of the north is a better
rider than his brother of the south. The horses are, I fancy, much
the same.</p>

<p>Many Patagonian horses are what may be called "quick to
mount," starting at a canter as soon as their rider's foot touches
the stirrup. This also is the fault of the breakers-in. There are
few tricks more annoying or, upon a hillside, more dangerous.</p>

<p>After this short description my readers will be able to understand
more fully the happenings which I am about to describe.</p>

<p>On October 3 we set out from Mr. Greenshields', and at the
moment of starting Fritz Gleditzsch, a German from Dresden,
whom I had brought with me from Buenos Aires, and whom I had
engaged on the best recommendations, came to me and told me
that he could not go farther because he had had no meat to eat
upon the previous night. As the meat-shed was situated about
two hundred yards from where my men were encamped, and as
he had free access to it, I began to understand that Fritz was
something of an old soldier. Had I been able to get another
man to replace him on the spot I should have done so, but with
my large troop of horses I was more or less in the hands of
my <i>peones</i>, a not uncommon difficulty to overtake the traveller
in Patagonia, and one upon which many <i>peones</i> count.</p>

	PATAGONIA.</p>
<p class="caption"><a href="images/i_059l.jpg">View larger image</a></p>
</div>

<p>The real reason for Fritz's recalcitrance turned out to be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
arrival in my camp of a compatriot and erstwhile companion,
Hans Hollesen, who had applied to join the expedition. I took
them both along, for, having paid Master Fritz's way from Buenos
Aires, I did not relish the notion of obtaining no return for the
outlay, and I knew that, once we passed Colohuapi, I should be
master of the situation.</p>

<p>I heard months afterwards from a New Zealander, who had
been on board the <i>Primero de Mayo</i> with Fritz, that that gentleman
was looking forward to a soft job, and had boasted that he
would certainly desert us if we marched more than ten miles a
day.</p>

<p>Our first march was about three leagues, and we made our camp
beside a small shallow lagoon upon which a couple of ashy-headed
geese (<i>Bernicla poliocephala</i>) were swimming. I shot them both
for the pot.</p>

<p>It was about six o'clock when we camped, and Burbury, who
was in charge of the horses, took every possible precaution to
prevent their straying, a very likely contingency upon their first
night in the open pampa. In spite of the fact that the horses were
watched all night, morning found us with but thirty-seven out of
the whole number. Soon after daylight Burbury, with some of the
men, rode out to recover them. They returned unsuccessful.
During the morning a wandering Gaucho came into camp and
said he had seen some horses in a <i>cañadon</i> near by. The Welshmen
rode out there but came back disappointed, as the horses were
not ours. At eleven o'clock next morning I sent three of the men
back to Mr. Haddock's, from whose <i>estancia</i> the lost troop had
been acquired, the probabilities being that they had headed back
for home. But shortly after Burbury and the Germans returned
with the horses, which had travelled about nine miles, and were
discovered calmly feeding in a <i>cañadon</i>. It was Burbury who discovered
them by a smart piece of Gaucho work.</p>

<p>Next night, October 6, we watched the horses in turns. It
was a cold night lit by a moon. We had some reason to believe
that our Gaucho friend of the day before had not been altogether
innocent in connection with the straying of the horses. Such a
man will ride quietly through the scattered horses feeding in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
gloom and stampede them. He will follow a small mob and drive
them into some fold of the hills, such as, no doubt, he knows a
dozen of, and hide them there until, after several days, a reward is
offered by the owner. The Gaucho will then ride casually into
the camp, drink a <i>maté</i>, hear the story, and remark that he is well
acquainted with the country round. If asked whether he can give
any opinion as to the whereabouts of the lost horses, he says,
"<i>Quien sabe?</i>" but suggests they may be in a "<i>cañadon muy
limpio</i>," to which horses often stray. In reply to any question
as to where the <i>cañadon</i> may lie, he replies, "Over there," and
waves his hand half round the compass. He may add that he is
looking for seven mares of his own that strayed away last Friday
week or he would himself undertake the office of guide. If any
hint of payment be given, he goes on to say that, since his mares
have been lost so long they may remain lost a little longer, while
he guides and aids the travellers in their search, not, of course, for
the money's worth, that will not recompense him for the mares,
which may wander away altogether out of the province because of
his delay in looking for them, but because he would do a kindness
to persons for whom he has conceived a liking. So he acts as
guide, and, after a decent interval, finds the horses and pouches
his reward. It is an excellent trade, as there is no risk and plenty
of emolument to recommend it, and, in fact, it is a common enough
trick in Patagonia.</p>

<p>I sat most of the night by the fire&mdash;except when my turn came
to ride round the horses, which we had placed in a small hollow&mdash;writing
up my diary by the light of the fire, and watching the men
ride in and out of the moonlight and the shadows. As the night
advanced the cold increased. The moon left us about 3.30 <span class="s08">A.M.</span>
and it became very dark. As I circled on my beat I passed by a
wild cat. Morning found the horses all right. We had, however,
to delay a little to allow of our men returning from Haddock's.</p>

<p>On October 7 we fared forth once more upon our way, and
the ill-luck that had attended us at this first camp was with us up
to the last moment of the three days we spent there, for as
the waggon began to move off an <i>alazan</i> fell beneath the front
wheel, which passed clean over his near fore leg. Strangely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
enough, owing to some inequality of the ground, the waggon,
although very heavily laden, did not hurt the animal. He was not
even cut, and when we got him up he resumed his journey as
if nothing had happened, and eventually turned out one of our best
horses.</p>

<p class="caption">J. B. SCRIVENOR (GEOLOGIST) AND MULA</p>
</div>

<p>We now made two or three good marches in succession, but on
October 10, in spite of all precautions, the horses belonging to the
black mare's troop deserted her.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Upon this, finding that until
the horses of the different troops became more used to each other,
it would be almost impossible to keep them together on the open
pampas, where, as a further disadvantage, the grass was poor and
sparse, and the horses had to scatter a great deal to feed, I decided
to cut across to the Rio Chico of Chubut and march along the
river valley, the tall cliffs of which would serve as a barrier to prevent
the <i>tropilla</i> straying. Never was such an awful place as these
pampas in which to lose anything, or, worse still, to get lost yourself.
You ride a hundred yards or so and you are in some deep-mouthed
<i>cañadon</i>, lying flush with the pampa, and out of sight of your companions
in an instant.</p>

<p>On the expedition we spoke four languages&mdash;Spanish, English,
German and Welsh, but English was more used than the others.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>On one occasion we had to light a couple of fires to signal some
of the men who were out looking for horses; one of these spread
rather much, but was easily put out with a spade. It is strange
how small an area burns in that part of the country, even with
a high wind to help the flames. The weather was windy and
bitterly cold.</p>

<p>I extract the following from my diary:</p>

<p>"<i>October 10, evening.</i>&mdash;I write this by the camp-fire. The
men take it in turns to cook. Two armadillos (<i>Dasypus minutus</i>)
have been caught by the Germans. They are strong little beasts;
you can hardly pull one, which has half buried itself in the
ground, out with both hands. We roast them whole with hot
stones and they taste like chicken. Fritz and Hollesen went
for the horses this morning and found three of the Trelew troop
gone, the Tordillo, the Zaino, and the Blanco, and this although
one was <i>maneado</i> and the other two tied together. This is a great
hindrance. We got the waggon ready on the interminable pampa
and decided to strike down at once for the Rio Chico by way of a
large <i>cañadon</i> four and a half leagues long. This will add some days
to our journey to Colohuapi. But if we continue losing and searching
for horses, shall we ever get there? One day we cover twenty-one
miles, the next nothing, because of strayed horses. Nor can
you <i>soga</i> them up, for the grass is poor and they must have a large
range. Here we are in this huge country looking for horses upon
and about a pampa intersected by many <i>cañadones</i>, each of which
would take an entire week to explore thoroughly. At breakfast I
decided to march, sending Jones, who is a good tracker, off to see
if he could find the horses where he found them yesterday.</p>

<p>"We have a big buck-jumper, a piebald, which is a strong horse
suited to the waggon. It took an hour and a half to get him
harnessed, and we started on the back track, for the <i>cañadon</i>
we must strike lies a league behind us. Barckhausen was to
ride an untamed black horse with the strangest light blue glimmering
eyes, which for some reason makes me repeat over and
over to myself the lines of Q.:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"His glittering eyes are the salt seas' prize,</p>
<p>And his fingers clutch the sand.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<p>"Rather far fetched, but so it always is. One notices how much in
camp-life a man gets into the habit of a 'Punch, brothers, punch'&mdash;a
haunting phrase which he applies to everything. In one case
it is some grim and grotesque oath that he mentally lives on,
sometimes it is a line of a hymn, sometimes it is a bit of an advertisement.
There are few books in the camp, and mine not out yet
from the tin box. The Welshmen have a Bible in their own
language; Hollesen has a paper of short stories about missing
heirs and such like; Scrivenor has 'Pickwick.'</p>

</div>

<p>"But to return to Barckhausen. The nag of the baleful eye
would not be caught, and had to be chased about the pampa by
Hughes and myself. Finally, Jones got a lasso on him, and he
danced at the edge of the lagoon with four men at the other end of
the lasso. We tied his legs in slip-knots and pulled him over, and
when quieter saddled him. He bucked around with the saddle.
At length Barckhausen got up and rode him the whole afternoon.
It was a terrible job driving the horses, and that even though we
were in the <i>cañadon</i>.</p>

<p>"On each side of us were bare, bald grass hills, rolling in
hummocks and their sides sprinkled with thorn-scrub. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
centre, winding in sharp bends, a dry river bed. Towards
evening, after travelling all the afternoon down the <i>cañadon</i>
since one o'clock, I rode on and found the bed of the river held
water in four places. Near the third of these we camped. Saw
an ostrich and a few sentinel guanaco. Caught an armadillo.
The scenery here consists of alternations of pampa and <i>cañadon</i>,
<i>cañadon</i> and pampa, and over all the tearing wind, which seldom
drops.</p>

<p>"I have given out two tins of jam and one of Swiss milk, one of
coffee and milk and some vegetables. Sometimes we soak our
biscuit and bake it. It is very good treated so. I am writing this
by the fire at seven o'clock. Coldish.</p>

<p>"Jones has not turned up yet, and must have had to sleep out in
nothing save a blanket, poor chap! He was to have cut our tracks
and followed them up.</p>

<p>"<i>October 11.</i>&mdash;All our <i>tropillas</i> right this morning, and at 8.30
I rode out of the camp and met Jones, who had found the three
strayed horses about a league from the old camp.</p>

<p>"We started and made our way down the empty river-bed,
which now broadened and was pebbly, like a Scotch trout-stream.
Before we left Mal Espina <i>estancia</i> the foreman told us the road
down the <i>cañadon</i> was very clear&mdash;'<i>muy limpio</i>,' and only four
and a half leagues in length, but we have been in it two days and
are in it still. About 5, as I was riding ahead with the troop of
horses, I came upon the track of wheels in deep scrub. I went
back to the waggon and found it on the left bank of the river-bed.
Upon one side were thorn-bush and sand, and upon the other a
swampy <i>vega</i> of wet grass. Through this the track led, and into
this the waggon lumbered, then two of the horses foundered in the
black mud and the waggon sank. Of course that put an end to our
day's journey, and I sent on Jones to bring back Burbury and the
troop. We were in a land of many flies, chiefly sand-flies, which
buzzed and stung horribly. Jones had tied up the horses on the
Rio Chico and we could not reach them to-night. Fritz found
sixteen eggs in an ostrich's nest and Hollesen found one. The
one was fine but the sixteen were chickenny.</p>

<p>"We all turned to, unloaded the waggon and pulled it out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
with some toil from the marsh, and before dinner loaded it up
again.</p>

<p>"By evening we reached the <i>cañadon</i> of the Rio Chico and
camped upon the banks.</p>

<p>"<i>October 12.</i>&mdash;With an effort got away by nine o'clock. I rode
on down the <i>cañadon</i>, as we had no meat and some was wanted.
We appear to be now entering a good game country. Saw five
ostriches. I rode the big Tostado. He loped lazily across stony
ridges, which crawl to the foot of the purple hills that are on the
other side of the Chico. Two herds of guanaco fled while I was on
the horizon. I cantered a long way, it seemed very far, over the
rolling ridges of pebble and thorn-bush. Mirages smoked and
danced on the horizon. I came at length to the waggon-track
which runs through the wild gorge of the Chico, and is only used
about once or twice a year. I rode down this track, and at the
side found a single ostrich egg. Shortly after I sighted the horses,
which Jones had tied up here and there. I left my belt and the
egg, and went back into the scrub to seek for that game which I
could not find. Saw one guanaco, but it had seen me first, and
would not let me approach within a quarter of a mile. Sighted the
horses and waggon far away on the high ground and rode to meet
them. Put them in a new troop and got away again at one o'clock.
Found that if I could not shoot a guanaco we must open our
reserve of tinned meat, and I did not wish to begin upon it so soon.
Rode on ahead of the troop revolving these matters. My horse
was extra lazy. I was thinking of the ostriches I had observed when
I saw over a ridge to the left the ears of a guanaco. There was a
dry nullah-bed which curved in beneath the ridge. It was pebbly
and sparsely set with thorn. I lay down and crawled until I came
to some water, and then I looked again. I could see the first
guanaco, an old buck, peering with his long neck swaying, and
looking at the Tostado which I had tied up. To tie up your horse
in view is the most successful thing you can do in this country of
long-necked game, and of game which is so often pursued with
dogs and on horseback. Sometimes the most ordinary game takes,
from the circumstances surrounding its pursuit, a reflected interest
not its own. So it was in this case; nor, indeed, is the guanaco
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
always an easy quarry, in fact it is a shy animal in the districts
where it is hunted by Indians.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> I crawled along, just a thorn-bush,
and that a lean one, between me and detection. I had set my
hopes on a low green belt of poison-scrub, and this I attained
at last. From it I saw a
foot of the big buck's
neck and the heads and
ears of six more. I had
made up my mind to
take a fine bead shot,
but he gave me no
chance of doing so. I
had only time to snap
him as he saw me. The
bullet smashed his neck.
As the others ran away
I put two shots out of
four into one, and killed
it as it entered the scrub
of thick, thorny, califate
bushes that lived hardily
there in the valley. I
went on after shooting the guanaco and left Fritz and Hughes to
cut up the meat. We made a league and a half through the gorge
of the Chico when up came Fritz and said the waggon was broken
down by, so he explained, a "horse falling on the pole" within a
hundred yards of where I had shot the guanaco. This was a disaster
indeed. Here were we just doing a good march when this wretched
breakdown occurred. We turned the troop and went back only to
find the waggon, a league away, coming merrily towards us. They
said it could go no farther, but after repairs it achieved a league
and a half more.</p>

<p>"Passing along we agreed it was a good country for lions
(<i>F. c. puma</i>, locally called lions). We encamped beneath a high cliff,
sixty feet of moss-grown basaltic rock beside the muddy river,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
where it winds through the marshes. In the night the dogs began
to bark, for a lion came into camp. We could hear it moving by
the dead camp-fire among the pots and pans. Burbury fired his
revolver in its direction; he was sleeping on the outside of the
tent. This morning we have found the lion's lair, twenty yards
up in the rock above
our camp. Fritz said
last night, 'And if you
hear me cry out, it is
the lion, he zomp on
me.'</p>

<p class="caption"><i>FELIS CONCOLOR PUMA</i></p>
</div>

<p>"Fritz is very jocular
sometimes: 'Aha,
my little horse, he
zomp!' and 'Mine little
bitch, you go and catch
a guanaco.' To-night
he was roasting an ostrich
egg and it exploded
and shot him all over with yellow yolk. He remarked, 'He
is goot, this egg, but he smell a bit of skunk.'</p>

<p>"<i>October 13.</i>&mdash;Mending waggon, no wood. At ten o'clock
waggon mended but needed a rest in the sun till the hide of
guanaco we had bound it with should dry. So I decided to take
to-day as our Sunday and march to-morrow. Burbury is making
a plum-duff. Served out tobacco this morning.</p>

<p>"Mock Sunday and at rest, a time for dreaming. Away at
home the trees are browning. How one's heart turns to them and
dreams of them! The men born out here wonder how we can
look forward to the happiness of going home, perhaps for the sight
of some village church hidden in English lanes and fields. Half
the charm of this life we are living out here lies in thinking
of our return to the land that gives us all comfort and a silent
welcome of green springs. Went out to-day after the lion and
found tracks, but the ground was too hard for following them
up. He lives in a valley of grey dead bush. As we went away
from the dead guanaco yesterday, a condor (<i>Sarcorhamphus</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
<i>gryphus</i>) appeared and dropped on the carcase almost before we
left it.</p>

</div>

<p>"<i>October 14, Sunday.</i>&mdash;We got away at nine o'clock and came
fast. The muddy narrow Chico flowing through a land which looks
as if it led over the edge of the world. It reminds one of a flowering
wilderness. Last night we tied up the dogs, and dear old Tom
howled till I had to get up and correct him. When up I let poor
little Lady loose, the last service I was ever destined to do for her,
for to-day the waggon went over her belly, and she lies dead on the
track a few leagues back. She was six months old, always cheerful,
and wagging her whip of a tail, always up to the march. Half an
hour before she died I saw her hunting a young fox, her first.
She had brown eyes and I had got fonder of her than I knew.
Tom used to drive her from her food, biting her, and from the
softest bed, and I am now glad to think I sometimes made him
give way to her. Just before Lady's death, I shot a cavy
(<i>Dolichotis patagonica</i>) with the Mauser. He gave me a nice shot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
sitting up on his haunches, near the track on the skyline of a low
bare ridge. Yesterday we had a very fine <i>puchero</i> or stew,
pickled eggs given me by Pedro at Camerones and two plum-duffs
made with waggon-grease by Burbury, who is quite a <i>chef</i> at
plum-duff. After our meal we had out the concertina and found
that Burbury knew 'The Church's One Foundation,' and Jones a
melancholy Welsh hymn.</p>

<p>"The two best of my horses have sore backs.</p>

<p>"We spent an hour trying to get the waggon up a steep ridge
100 feet high, and had to unload and all work at it. Made a long
seven leagues and encamped at the foot of a ridge with 200 yards
of dead bush between us and the yellow Chico. Going very
pebbly, the ground here and there burnt up and arid. It is always
in such places that the mirages are most common.</p>

<p>"<i>October 15.</i>&mdash;Got off 8.40. At 11 unloaded waggon, which
was in great danger of turning over. Scrivenor photoed it. At
2.20 waggon horses unfit to go farther. Camped by the Chico;
shot a yellow-billed teal.</p>

<p>"<i>October 16.</i>&mdash;Out of humour all day, first, because, I found one
of the cameras put unprotected into the waggon among the tins of
potted meat, &amp;c. Wearily, wearily we wend our way towards the
blue distant hills of our desires. Even as in life we wend
towards distant ambitions, and, coming up to them, find new ones
arise upon the horizon beyond, and so we travel all our days, looking
longingly ahead. This valley of the Chico is a wild place,
conical hillocks of sand have now taken the place of the bush-covered
ones. The Chico remains yellow and winds greatly.
Purple hills crown the distance. It is all high-coloured and clear-shaded
as in a picture.</p>

<p>"To-day, coming round a bend of the Chico glen, I saw seven
guanaco feeding in the valley. They had seen me and begun to
move, so I galloped round the ridge, and as I jumped off my
horse one passed and halted within seventy yards. The herd
made a pretty picture standing on the bare, desert-brown hillside
in the tearing wind. I clean missed the buck with the first
shot, and only killed him as he ran off, hitting him low behind the
shoulder. The wind was blowing hard to-day and full in our faces.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>

<p>"A windy night, the sand of the river-bed driving and filling
everything. Presently we shall crawl into our sleeping-bags and,
with our feet to the wind, bid any weather defiance. A pipe is a
mighty ally. Here am I in the little 4 ft. tent which Burbury and
Scrivenor have pitched to sleep in, wrapped in a poncho a-reek
with the smoke of Indian camp-fires, enjoying a pipe and writing
this, and as it grows too dark to write and the wind roars and
bellows louder down the river-bed, I shall sit here watching the red
glow of my pipe and dreaming.</p>

<p>"<i>October 17, 9 o'clock.</i>&mdash;A month hence from to-day will be my
birthday. Where shall we be? At the Lake Buenos Aires, I
hope. Several horses this morning have sore backs, and Burbury,
excellent fellow, has been doctoring them.</p>

<p>"How the face of this country changes with the weather!
Bleak and windy even in warm sunlight, though fine and bracing;
in evil weather it wears an aspect of forlornness. The farther you
penetrate into Patagonia the more its vast emptiness weighs on
you and overwhelms you.</p>

<p>"<i>Eleven o'clock.</i>&mdash;Where shall we be a month hence? Where,
indeed? To-day we had a great disappointment, and I hardly know
how to write of it. The natural difficulties of the country are very
great, but with care, in spite of boulders and hard-going, it seemed
as if I could get my waggon up to the foothills, and I looked
forward to bringing back many specimens in it. But after 300
and odd miles of travel a particularly hummocky valley proved too
much for its endurance. When the horses tried to move it this
morning it broke up altogether, and here it lies!</p>

<p>"Total day's march, 200 yards. Burbury and Jones have ridden
on towards Colohuapi, where there are some pioneers' huts, to try
and get wood and bolts. What is to be done? I do not know. Take
to <i>cargueros</i>? We could bring back no specimens to speak of in
that case. One must wait and see what Burbury can get from the
people at Colohuapi. The camp is in a valley and is surrounded
by bare mud cones 100 feet in height, a few bushes shiver in the
throat of the upper end of the gorge. In the gorge and round our
camp-fire spreads a growth of rank lean weed, full of yellow flowers,
and a few small wind-polished stones lie at the base of one of the
ant-heaplike hills.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<p>"'Oh, the dreary, dreary moorland! Oh, the weary, weary
shore' (of the Chico)! I took my gun down to the river and
shot five widgeon (<i>Mareca sibilatrix</i>) and six martinetas (<i>Calodromas
elegans</i>).</p>

<p>"Late in the evening Scrivenor and I went up over the ridge of
bare hills rather with the idea of shooting, if possible, a condor we
had seen poised high up. Sight at back came off Scrivenor's
Mauser.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> We went on and saw a herd of guanaco, one much
nearer than the rest, and we crawled towards him. The stones were
a penance. The only cover was thorn, and little of that up there
on the high pampa above the valley where our camp is. At two
hundred yards I shot and hit him, but he went on, and presently
swayed his neck and lay down. I crawled up and had a shot at
his neck. Thereafter followed periods of cantering in a rickety
way, followed by periods of lying down, and at last we went round
over a rise and crawled down on him. I thought he was dead but for
the shadow of his neck, and I crawled on with but one cartridge left
in my gun. As I neared him, up he got and I fired again and hit
him. He was growing very weak. Scrivenor shouted that he had
no revolver, and so here were we with only our knives. I followed
the guanaco and Scrivenor went round. I was upon him first
but my knife was weak. Scrivenor, startled from his usual calm,
and with a shout, leaped at the guanaco and caught him round
the neck. So we bore him to earth and slew him. I examined
him for wounds and found four. Two of the shots were vital,
yet he had led us a chase of two and a half miles, and we had
to carry the meat back to camp. Arrived there, and preparing
a meal by the fire, in came Burbury and Jones. They had met
a Gaucho trekking to Colohuapi, who told them that Colohuapi
was yet twenty-five leagues away and that there were no bolts
or wood to be had there. I went to bed and smoked, feeling
pretty sad. There is but one thing to do. We must jettison some
of the cargo and sew up the rest in the skins of guanacos, and go
forward with pack-horses."</p>

</p>

<p>Morning (19th) came to us very grey with a pallid sun, and
ushered in the first day of the new system. We found it necessary
to use sixteen horses as <i>cargueros</i> or pack-horses. In the early
dawn we caught the chosen animals, and tied them up to
the smashed waggon. It is
one of the inconveniences of
pampa travel that bushes
strong enough to hold a horse
which is at all restive are few
and far between. In that
particular spot there was absolutely
nothing in the way
of a bush, however small,
which could by any chance
have borne the strain.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a name="i_074" id="i_074"></a>
<img src="images/i_074.jpg" width="352" height="249" alt="" />
<p class="caption">READY TO BE CARGOED</p>
</div>

<p>So we tied them up to the
waggon and they immediately proceeded to tie themselves and
their headropes into still more complicated knots: they made cats'
cradles, reef-knots, sliding nooses, a dozen knots one knew and a
dozen one had never dreamed of. Of the sixteen horses, half had
never had a cargo on their backs until that day; we had meant to
break them in, but the waggon succumbed too soon to the hardships
of the way, and before we had had time to carry out our intentions.</p>

<p>During the three days we remained in camp among the strong-scented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
yellow flowers where the waggon lay, all hands had been
hard at work sewing up stores into the skins of guanacos, which I
had killed for food on the march. The proper arranging of packs
for horses is a very difficult matter; shape, size and weight have
all to be considered. Each cargo should be divided into three
portions, the balance of the two sides being carefully adjusted, and
the centre piece, that which surmounts the pack-saddle, should not
be more than twelve inches high. There should be at least two
rugs and a sheepskin underneath the saddle. As we had not
enough sheepskins, the pelts of guanaco were in some cases made
to serve our purpose. Several different forms of pack-saddle have
each of them points to recommend them, but to my mind the form
used on the cattle-plains of North America is preferable to any
other, and is more easily loaded, as the horse can be led between
the two side-packs, which are hung along upon hooks attached to
the wooden frame of the saddle. The whole cargo is best kept in
place by means of a couple of <i>cinches</i> or girths. This form of
pack is, however, but little used in the Argentine Republic. With
such pack-saddles Hähansen and I, at a later date, travelled one
hundred and fifty miles, during which it was not necessary to stop
more than once or twice to readjust the cargoes.</p>

<p>During the whole of our subsequent wanderings, the horses
entered so much into our lives that some descriptive remarks
having regard to the peculiarities of each will perhaps not be out
of place. Any one who has been thrown very much into a close
association with horses can hardly have failed to notice the
extraordinary friendships which these animals not infrequently
form between themselves.</p>

<p>Among our troop there was a pale bronze-coloured horse to
which the Spanish language assigns the term <i>Gateado</i>. This
creature's whole life was spent in close attendance upon the largest
horse in the <i>tropilla</i>, a piebald, called by us the Big Overo. The
Big Overo was a buck-jumper, and when we wanted to catch him,
he and the Gateado, his intimate, were wont to evade us together. If
we could catch the Big Overo by craft, the Gateado was as good
as captured also; but if, unluckily, our first attempt upon the Big
Overo failed, both animals made a point of charging about the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
camp and frightening all the other horses. On one occasion,
when it was judged well to give the Big Overo a lesson, Hughes
<i>bolassed</i> him and after a gallop of a couple of hundred yards he
came to the ground in an inextricable tangle.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The Gateado
remained by his side
and allowed himself to
be caught without any
struggle. After a time
the intimacy between
these horses grew to such
a pitch that we gradually
dispensed with a rope for
the Gateado, knowing
that if the Big Overo was
once tied up his friend
would stand beside him
and allow us to put on his
cargo quietly. This odd
friendship finally reached such an extreme that when the Big
Overo was <i>sogaed</i> out for the night, the Gateado was in the habit
of giving up his hours of feeding in order to satisfy the claims of
friendship. The feeling was mutual, for the Big Overo manifested
almost as many proofs of his preference.</p>
<div class="figleft"><a name="i_076" id="i_076"></a>
<img src="images/i_076.jpg" width="391" height="320" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MRS TRELEW</p>
</div>

<p>Another case of friendship was struck up between two of the
<i>madrinas</i>, but this was an essentially feminine affection, all upon
one side. The Rosada would follow the Trelew mare, who was in
foal, and would hardly allow her to feed in peace. Mrs. Trelew,
as the men nicknamed the round-barrelled old black mare,
objected very strongly to the advances of her admirer, and once
they had a regular quarrel owing to Mrs. Trelew kicking the
Rosada with such force as to nearly break her ribs, which the
latter rather resented. The Rosada was a vicious unbacked brute
within five yards of whose heels it was unsafe to approach, and
she, in common with the long-maned Little Zaino, acquired the
execrable habit of attempting to kick any one who on horseback
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
ventured to come near. This is a trick that is very rare even
among the most untamable and vicious horses, which, although
they will kick a man on foot, will seldom do so when he is
mounted.</p>

<div class="figright"><a name="i_077" id="i_077"></a>
<img src="images/i_077.jpg" width="292" height="190" alt="" />
<p class="caption">YEGUA ROSADA</p>
</div>

<p>Then there was the Old Zaino, a melancholy animal of the
sardonic school. He was the worst of all the horses. I remember
once Burbury making me laugh very
much by saying in a moment of
indignation: "You haven't been a
colt these thirty years, you evergreen
son of a buckjumper!" This
horse had a way of coming to standstill
in the very centre of the troop
on the march, and, after regarding
us with a patient but baleful eye, he
would solemnly buck all his cargo
off and attempt to kick it to pieces. At one time he was used as
a riding-horse, having, indeed, a turn for speed, but his paces
were so rough and his trick of rearing as one was mounting so
uncomfortable that we were compelled to make him one of the
<i>cargueros</i>.</p>

<p>But perhaps the horse that caused us the most amusement was
the Asulejo. He was a sort of uncertain dapple-grey in colour,
and to look at him you would say that a more quiet, lazy, say-nothing-to-anybody
little bit of old age did not crop the grass in
Patagonia. Often and often did we feel sorry for that little animal
and lighten his load. One afternoon, as we came along with the
waggon, he seemed to be thinking more and more of the past, of
the time when he had the power to make his riders sit tight and
used to be a creature of some truculence. He had upon his back
a light cargo of cooking-pots, and it took the undivided attention
of one man to keep him at a walk. We fixed our camp upon an
open plateau of coarse grass and thorn beside a lagoon in a shallow
hollow. The cargoes were pulled off and the cook of the night
made a grateful smoke ascend. I took a shot-gun and went after
some geese for the morrow's breakfast. It was, perhaps, an hour
and a half later, and a good league from camp, that I heard the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
neighing of horses, and was surprised to see seventeen of our
troop hurrying off, as it were, upon some unknown errand. And
well in front of them&mdash;could I believe my eyes?&mdash;was the horse we
knew as the Asulejo, but his eye was brighter and he neighed in
the joy of his heart as he trotted friskily along! He was the
obvious leader of the revolt. No sooner did he see me than he
fell behind, trying to look as though one of the younger animals
had lured him from the path of duty, but that pretence did not
serve, and after driving him back into camp we put <i>maneas</i> on
him, upon which he recognised with the philosophy of age that he
could not fight against the inevitable, and so retired into the lee of
a thorn-bush, where he lay down to dream, no doubt, of the days
when things were different and he had been a scampering three-year-old
on the banks of the River Negro.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_078" id="i_078"></a>
<img src="images/i_078.jpg" width="550" height="398" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE ASULEJO</p>
</div>

<p>However, to return to our journey, and our earliest attempt
at marching without a waggon. It was first and last one of the
most trying days that we experienced. To begin with, the eight
fairly well-behaved horses were cargoed up, and then the wild ones
were taken in hand. The first of these happened to be the
Gateado. His load was flour and tinned beef. He allowed himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
to be saddled up with no more than the usual accompaniment
of blowing and snorting. He even suffered his cargo to be slung
and the noose to be slipped along the <i>cinch</i> until it was in place.</p>

<p>Every horse needs two men to put on his cargo. One ties the
knot and hauls while the other takes in the slack. The latter has
to hold up his side of the cargo with his shoulder, and to do this
must get pretty nearly under the animal.</p>

<p>In our case, although we jettisoned a portion of our belongings&mdash;including,
I am sorry to say, a number of birds which I had spent
my evenings in skinning, and which I truly grieved to leave
behind&mdash;some of the packs were of necessity rather unwieldy.
This, indeed, is almost always the case during the earlier stages
of any expedition.</p>

<p>The behaviour of the Gateado was similar to that of many of
the <i>cargueros</i>. He waited until his man was well under, and then
he came into action with a series of diabolically well-aimed, one-legged
kicks. Having after a little got rid of us by this means,
he went on to buck all his cargo off, and then stood with his saddle
cork-screwed round under his belly. Jones held on to the head-rope,
or no doubt the Gateado would have completed his performance
by clearing off into the low hills or hummocks which surrounded
the place.</p>

<p>Most of the others were, in their separate ways, as bad as the
Gateado. Some bucked, some reared, some would not be
approached, but all agreed in one thing&mdash;all, when cargoed up and
ready for the start, solemnly lay down and rolled on their cargoes.
If they got them loose, the wretched animals rose again and bucked
them within reach of their heels, after which they extricated themselves
by kicking.</p>

<p>That morning was, indeed, a study of shifting cargoes. They
came off all ways, bucked off, kicked off, rolled on. Some stuck
out to port of the horse and some to starboard, a few hung disconsolately
beneath the <i>carguero's</i> body. Again and again we did
our part, and again and again the horses defeated us by their
horrible tricks of lying down and rolling. Meantime the sun had
risen, and heat and flies were added to the long tally of the day's
disagreeable items. A very heavy wind was also blowing, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
made it exceedingly difficult to place the saddle-cloths upon the
horses' backs. I have often noticed that, when saddling up a colt
or wild horse, it is well to make use each day of the same saddle-cloths,
as he grows used to these, and does not fear them, especially
if you allow him to bite and smell them.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_080" id="i_080"></a>

<div class="figcenter">
	<img src="images/i_081.jpg" width="550" height="533" alt="" />
</div>

<p>At length, however, shortly after midday the horses began to
get worn out. The cargoed ones ceased to struggle and lay still,
tongues out, fat-barrelled, like a troop on a battle-field, humped
with cargo and grotesquely dead. In the fighting-line, I remember,
remained only a horse named Horqueta (the slit-eared), and the
indefatigable Gateado. Horqueta's cargo consisted of a pair of
tin boxes, for, bucking apart, he was a fairly steady pack-horse.
He and the Gateado were the last to be finished, the others having
yielded after the long struggle of the forenoon.</p>

<p>All would now have gone well had it not been for the fact that
the handles of one of the tin boxes upon Horqueta were loose.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
The moment we let him go he began to buck and the unlucky
handles to beat a devil's tattoo upon the body of the tin box. He
made off into the troop of cargoed horses, and the noise he brought
with him proved too much for their nerves. They scrambled up
to their feet and four of them broke away in different directions.
Five minutes later we surveyed once more a scene of scattered
cartridges, flour, oatmeal, sacks of beans, clothes, skins bumped
out with tinned provisions, and I don't know what else. They lay
in confusion among the grass and bushes in the valley, and up
and down the slopes of the conical mud hills. The Germans were
reduced to inarticulate oaths, and the Welshmen looked out of
heart.</p>

<p>But to camp upon a failure is the worst of business and of
policy, and so the men were laughed into a good humour, and we
all went at it once more, the ammunition and our other goods were
collected and the cargoes were fixed up yet again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>It was ten minutes past three o'clock by my watch when we
rode slowly up the cliff that lay between Waggon Camp and the
River Chico of Chubut. We reached the top without mishap,
chiefly, I think, because the horses were now fairly exhausted
with their exertions. At the top of the rise we stopped and
looked back; our broken waggon lay dark and low among
the coarse yellow weeds, the afternoon sun, still warm, beat
upon the bald hills, and that was the last we saw of our unlucky
camp.</p>

<p>The procession moved slowly on, and we did not rest until
twilight, by which time we had travelled between twelve and
thirteen miles. Our march now lay along the banks of the Chico.
The going was soft, and more bushes began to appear on the landscape.
That night we celebrated our first <i>carguero</i> journey by
serving out cocoa for all hands.</p>

<p>The night we struck the River Chico was a very cold one, the
temperature falling 12° below freezing-point. These figures,
however, give no idea of the cold, as one of the characteristics of
Patagonia is the prevalence of tremendous winds. And when
these blow from the direction of the Cordillera, they bring with
them chilly memories of the snows over which they have passed.
Wind, of course, increased the rigours of the cold, and I remember
that during the night on which we felt the cold most severely the
temperature did not fall below 35°.</p>

<p>The next morning we got off about 10.30, having less trouble
with the <i>cargueros</i>. I went on in front to choose our way, which
here passed over very bad ground.</p>

<p>At the midday halt it was found that only part of a haunch of
guanaco had been brought on from the last camp. I therefore
galloped on ahead with a shot-gun and shot thirteen ducks, of
which only six came to hand, as several fell among the reeds in the
marshes which fringe the river. Of these six ducks, four were
brown pintails (<i>Dafila spinicauda</i>) and two were Chiloe widgeon
(<i>Mareca sibilatrix</i>). In the afternoon I exchanged the shot-gun
for the rifle, as a few more guanaco-skins would be very handy for
various purposes and meat was wanted. About four o'clock, when
riding behind the troop, I saw a guanaco among the hills to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
east. I was fortunately mounted upon the Cruzado, who had by
this time learned to stand to shot and to remain standing when his
reins were dropped over his head. He was infinitely the best
shooting-horse in the troop, and
I used always to ride him when
game was wanted, although,
owing to his being a large horse,
his canter was not suited to
riding behind the <i>tropilla</i>. He
had come to us with a very bad
name for throwing himself back,
which is one of the nastiest
tricks a horse can possess. But
this he soon gave up, and except
that he always remained
rather hard to catch in the
mornings, was what an advertiser
would call "a thoroughly
confidential horse." I am glad
to think that when I left Patagonia he became the property of
Burbury.</p>

<div class="figright"><a name="i_083" id="i_083"></a>

<p class="caption">THE AUTHOR'S TWO BEST HORSES, THE CRUZADO
AND ALAZAN</p>
</div>

<p>The Cruzado seemed to enter into the spirit of the chase, and
in the present instance went off at a fast canter towards the hills.
The guanaco had moved from his point of vantage upon the top of
a conical hill of mud, and had probably, according to the custom of
these animals, sought another eminence. I thought he had seen me,
in which case he would at once have made for the highest point
within reach, but, as I came into the throat of the gorge where there
were some mud hills, I saw him again upon the side of a large
hummock one hundred feet or so in height. I immediately tied up
my horse.</p>

<p>The guanacos of the valley of the Chico were very wild owing
to the fact that the Tehuelche Indians hunt them there during the
months of October and November. This valley was once celebrated
for the abundance of its game, but of recent years the herds seem
to have moved westwards and northwards. This guanaco was the
first we had seen that day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<p>I crawled up the hill, sinking to my knees at every step into
the dry mud. When half-way up I saw the ears of the guanaco
appear against the sky-line. I lay down, and he remained still and
utterly unconscious of my presence for some minutes. He was
watching my companions, who, with the horses, were moving off
into dimness down the valley. Presently he ran forward one or
two steps and gave out his high-pitched neighing laugh in a sort of
strange defiance at our retreating troop. He was a very old buck
with dark markings on his face. He was about fifty yards away,
and when I fired he reared and fell backwards. I threw out the
cartridge, and at the same instant seven guanacos, startled by the
report, dashed across the valley and galloped along parallel to
me on the other side of the <i>cañadon</i> at about one hundred yards
distance. I fired at the second one because it looked fat, and
brought it to the ground. The guanacos now turned in great
affright and raced past me again, when I dropped two more.
This brought them to a standstill, as they had not yet made
out where the shots were coming from, and no doubt I might
have been able to shoot the entire herd, but we had now
enough skins. When I rose the remaining four sprang down
into the valley and disappeared up the opposite <i>barranca</i>.</p>

<p>I now went to the top of the hill, where I had fired at the old
buck, and found that the bullet had broken his neck. He was, as
I had surmised, a very old animal, and bore upon him traces of an
encounter with a puma. The skin of his neck was immensely
thick and his teeth were worn down. One of the other guanacos,
which had fallen upon the far side of the valley, proved to be
a year-old doe, so it was unnecessary to take any of the meat
of the buck. I now signalled, and Burbury soon joined me to help
in cutting up.</p>

<p>When we overtook the horses we found that the hounds, Tom
and Bian had killed a cavy (<i>Dolichotis patagonica</i>), so that we had
a good stock of meat. The cavy is excellent eating, resembling
English hare. I was told that Tom had not covered himself with
glory, for, although he proved himself very fast, and turned the
hare, it was Bian that killed it. Bian was a rough, yellow lurcher,
who stood the rough ground and hard experiences of our journey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
very much better than Tom, although the latter was a well-bred
hound with a pedigree to back his pretensions. Bian belonged to
young Jones.</p>

<p>During the day we observed enormous flocks of Chilian widgeon
(<i>Mareca sibilatrix</i>) as well as some grey teal (<i>Querquedula
versicolor</i>).</p>

<p>On October 22, as we had expected, we arrived at Colohuapi,
the farthest settlement in the heart of Patagonia. Near by lie
twin lakes Colhué and Musters. About one o'clock, coming over a
rise, we saw the Lake. As the sun was shining it was very blue,
and upon the far side rose the hills. The mournful whistle of
waterfowl in countless flocks was to be heard. A breeze from the
north-west was blowing across the lake, and there was that peculiar
wet smell in the wind which can only be derived from a passage
across wide waters.</p>

<p>This day the Gateado bucked off his cargo of tinned meats and
was unfortunate enough to give himself a deep wound in the
pastern. Jones tied it up with his handkerchief, and the horse was
so lame that we thought it would be necessary to leave him behind
at Colohuapi. As it turned out, however, being of a very strong
constitution, he improved rapidly, and was with us to the very end
of our journeyings.</p>

<p>Our march on this occasion was upwards of twenty-seven miles,
and at the end of it I rode ahead to choose a place for a camp.
Earlier in the day Burbury, who was riding the Colorado, a half-broken
colt that had had only a few gallops, got into difficulties, and
I relieved him of a bag which he was carrying. I had tied this bag
to my saddle, but just before we camped it came loose, and, thinking
I was not going to have any other chance of shooting, I slung it
over my rifle, which I was carrying across my shoulder as usual
in a sling. I had chosen a valley to camp in and turned round to
jog quietly back to meet the troop, when with the tail of my eye
I caught sight of an animal which I thought was Tom, but it
looked too large, and I turned my head to see it more fully.
There, fifteen yards behind my horse, staring at me, switching
its tail slowly from side to side, and standing full up, was a fine
male puma (<i>F. concolor</i>). I rolled off my horse, which, fortunately,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
had neither seen nor winded the puma, and began to unsling my
rifle. In the middle of the operation, when I already had the
hindering bag upon the ground, the puma, which up to that moment
had continued to lash its tail and stare at me, turned round and
loped off at the cumbrous and uncouth canter habitual to these
animals. At one hundred and fifty yards it stopped for an instant,
but was off again at once. I attempted to mount my horse with
the idea of galloping down the puma, an easy thing to do, as
these animals never run far, and are readily blown, but the horse,
which happened to be a mule-footed <i>oscuro</i>, known as Mula,
became quite unmanageable. I at once coo-ed and was joined by
young Humphrey Jones, who in eighteen years' residence in Patagonia
had never seen a puma, and as he had strong sporting
instincts, was extremely anxious to encounter one. We followed
the track of the lion&mdash;as the puma is locally called&mdash;but after
topping the hill it led along a bare slope and was lost in a clump of
high dry bush, where it was quite hopeless to find the creature.
We rode back into camp very disappointed.</p>

<p>Just as Mr. Selous remarks that hunters sometimes spend years
in Africa before they come upon their first lion, so many a man is
as long in Patagonia before he comes across his first puma. The
puma is a very furtive and cowardly animal, and though we saw so
few during our months of travel, I have no doubt that many a
puma watched our troop passing across the pampa from the
safe cover of rocks and bushes. Seeing or not seeing pumas is
purely a matter of luck, and the tales concerning pumas having
attacked men, which abound in the country, are generally fabrications.
A puma with young will attack man if he stumbles upon
her and her family, and my friend Mr. Waag told me that on
one occasion a puma in the Cordillera had shown evident signs
of attack. In the majority of cases, even when wounded, the
puma will only snarl and spit, and the Indians, as well as the
Gauchos, despatch it with the <i>bolas</i>.</p>

<p>The puma is a terrible foe to the sheep-farmer, levying heavy
toll upon flocks, and often enjoys a long career of sheep-killing
before strychnine or the bullet puts an end to its existence.</p>

<p>The snow is directly responsible for the death of a great many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
pumas, for when it is lying on the ground the animals can easily
be tracked. At this season the shepherds of the <i>estancias</i> near the
coast attempt to clear the ground of their very unwelcome
visitors, the weapon most commonly used being the .450 revolver,
and the shot is often taken at a distance of less than ten paces.
The puma is very easy to kill, especially if the first shot is well
placed. It is the first shock which tells in the case of these
animals.</p>

<p>Great sport could, no doubt, be had with the puma were he
hunted with a pack of dogs that would bay him and distract his
attention. The average hound of the country is, however, far too
wise to pit himself against such an animal, and will often even
refuse to acknowledge the scent.</p>

<p>That night the lake, as seen from the camp, was wonderfully
beautiful. The waters were leaden-grey bounded by faint blue
hills, with soft mists of an unearthly green clinging about them.
The only sounds to be heard were the wash of the ripple on the
shore and plashing of wildfowl.</p>

<p>On October 23 we made as early a start as possible, and
pursued our way over very level pampa, which had not yet been
hardened by the sun of spring. We put up an ostrich (<i>Rhea
darwini</i>) from <i>his</i> nest, and found three eggs. Presently there
appeared in the centre of the pampa, ahead of us, three little huts
of earth and three black cattle. Save for one gorge through
which the River Senguerr flows, and through which we afterwards
took our way, a perfect circle of hills of greatly varying heights
surrounded the small settlement. The huts belonged to a Welshman
named William Jones, who, with his wife and six children, had
trekked out here some six or eight months previously.</p>

<p>One of the three huts, which was untenanted, Mr. Jones put
at our disposal, and after taking off the cargoes, Burbury and
Scrivenor accompanied me across to William Jones' home. Mrs.
Jones received us with hospitality and treated us to <i>maté</i> with milk,
tea and scones, and we got a sight of ourselves in the looking-glass.
The wind of the pampas had removed all the skin from our
faces, and we were a good deal unlike the individuals who had
started from Trelew some four or five weeks before.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_088" id="i_088"></a>
<img src="images/i_088.jpg" width="550" height="407" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SETTLEMENT OF COLOHUAPI</p>
</div>

<p>That night the men slept inside the hut, but it was too warm
for my sleeping-bag, so I took up my bed and went out, passing
the night on the lee side of the hut. Perhaps what delighted us
most was the fact that in the shelter of the hut we were able to
smoke our pipes in peace, safe from the buffeting of the wind.</p>

<p>At dawn Mrs. Jones kindly sent her children over with a pail
of milk. It would be impossible to imagine any more healthy
specimens of the Welsh race than these sun-kissed, clear-eyed
youngsters. Ruddy and brown and strong, the air of the wilderness
had need of no better proof of its splendid health-giving
qualities. I gave the children chocolate from our store, a luxury to
which they were not accustomed, and which they enjoyed immensely.</p>

<p>William Jones had brought his wife and family to Colohuapi in
a waggon, following the banks of the River Chico from Trelew.
His journey had, however, been made late in the year, when the
marshes were dry, and his waggon had been more suited to the
hardships of the way than was ours.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>Two other Welshmen with their wives lived higher up the
valley, and the full strength of the colony was made up by a
Swede named Oscar, who acted as <i>comisario</i>, and an Argentine
who had settled on the other side of the river. To the last-named
gentleman Burbury paid a visit on the following day.</p>

<p>Now set in another era of preparation. We purchased sheepskins
and laid in a stock of mutton, and on the 25th once more
made a start. Before taking leave of Colohuapi I should like to
record my appreciation of the great kindness which the settlers
there extended to us especially Mr. and Mrs. William Jones, the
latter of whom was thoughtful enough to bake us a large loaf to
speed us on our way. On the eve of our departure we gave a
small dinner, at which the <i>menu</i> was as follows: Mutton <i>puchero</i>,
made with desiccated potatoes and cabbage; stewed apple-rings
and milk; lime-juice tablets; chocolate food; and two tins of
sardines. I was very sorry not to be able to add a bowl of punch
to the feast, but the fact was I had with me but three bottles
of brandy, and those for purely medicinal purposes.</p>

<p>The country round about Colohuapi is very suited for cattle-breeding,
but, of course, the chief difficulty encountered by the
colonists are those connected with transporting their produce to
the market, as the district is not yet in any way opened up. But
I hope and believe that a prosperous future lies before the young
settlement, and much of the good to come should certainly fall to
the lot of the Welshmen William and Walter Jones, whose pioneer
efforts deserve great reward. At present it is a hard life that the
colonists are obliged to lead, divided as they are by more than a
couple of hundred miles from their nearest white neighbours. One
could not help being struck by the solitary aspect of the two or
three small huts, set as they are at present on the edge of the hill-encircled
empty plain.</p>

<p>Just as we were off from Colohuapi, the <i>comisario</i> rode up and
proceeded to make the necessary examination of our horses. In
this connection very strict laws obtain throughout the northern
provinces of the Argentine Republic. In a country where horse-breeding
is carried on upon so extensive a scale, and where,
besides, the animals are allowed to wander freely upon the wide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
spaces of the pampas, a strong check must be placed upon any
infringement of the law of property. A strict system of registration
and surveillance as to brands upon horses must be kept in
force, and is, in fact, one of the first steps towards security.</p>

<p>The brand, which I had registered in Trelew, and which was
invented by Burbury, represented the rising sun. It was an
excellent brand, as it had not much "fire" about it, and was very
different to any other mark we came across. Another point to be
considered in choosing it was that it would be a difficult one to
fake. Our branding took place at Bahia Camerones, Mr. Greenshields
being good enough to allow us to use his corral for the
purpose. Our half-wild horses did not permit us to operate upon
them without a struggle. A few days after the operation the
burns caused by the iron had quite healed.</p>

</p>

<p>In consequence of the visit of the <i>comisario</i> we were somewhat
late in starting from Colohuapi, but nevertheless made a good
march of about fifteen miles, and camped in the valley, after
driving the two horses past a bend of the river that would
prevent them from attempting to break back towards their pasture
at Colohuapi. The day was very warm indeed and the night
rather cold, the thermometer at midday and at night being
respectively 74° F. and 37° F.</p>

<p>We were now upon the banks of the River Senguerr, the
Senguel of Captain Musters.</p>

<p>The extraordinary tameness of the upland geese in the neighbourhood
of Colohuapi was very remarkable; they allowed one to
approach within eighty yards before bestirring themselves. After
the first day's march beyond Colohuapi we never saw again any
specimen of the Patagonian cavy (<i>Dolichotis patagonica</i>), although
round the shores of the lakes Musters and Colhué these animals
abound. It is strange that the habitat of the cavy should be so
sharply defined, considering that there appears to be no apparent
reason, such as alteration of the nature of the ground or vegetation,
to account for the fact. The armadillo (<i>Dasypus minutus</i>), which
is found in numbers on the north bank of the River Santa Cruz, is
entirely absent from the south bank, nor, to my knowledge, has a
single specimen ever been secured there. This instance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
distribution of the armadillo agrees with other facts of the same
kind which are common to Patagonia. The rivers running from
west to east across the continent mark the limit of the distribution
of some of the mammals. Thus I am assured the jaguar (<i>Felis onca</i>)
is not to-day found south of the River Negro. And the puma does
not exist in Tierra del Fuego, the dividing water in this latter
instance being the Straits of Magellan. The guanaco, however,
is distributed throughout the whole of Patagonia and also in Tierra
del Fuego. I met with this animal deep inside the Cordillera, and
indeed once, with consecutive shots, I killed a huemul and a
guanaco.</p>

<p>About this time it became apparent that neither Fritz nor
Hollesen, the German Gauchos, were very much in love with the
hard work and hardships which they conceived lay before them.
It was a favourite trick of theirs to fall out of the troop on the
plea of fixing a cargo, and then, as soon as we were lost to sight, to
sit down and smoke their pipes; in fact, they had determined to
take things easy. On the evening of our leaving Colohuapi
Hollesen asked me for some cartridges for his revolver, saying
that when working under the Argentine Boundary Commission
he had had a quarrel with an Indian concerning the Indian's
wife, and that he feared meeting him, for the man had sworn to
be revenged.</p>

<p>During the night the dogs ate about ten kilos of mutton
which we had brought with us from Colohuapi, although it was
wrapped up in a tent, so the next morning we were forced to
breakfast upon an old gander, that made a very tough and tasteless
<i>puchero</i>. Our next march was about six leagues, and that evening
an Indian rode into our camp and offered to guide us across the
pampa to Lake Buenos Aires. He was a Tehuelche, and he told
us that some of his tribe were encamped in the valley of the River
Mayo at its junction with the River Chalia. All the following day,
leaving the river and guided by the Indian, we rode across bare
stony pampa devoid of game, and in the evening, after passing
three lagoons, we made our camp round a spring of water. As,
owing to the depredations of the dogs, we had no fresh food, I
took the gun and attempted to stalk a couple of upland geese.

<p class="caption">THE GERMANS</p>
</div>

<p>As I was returning unsuccessful, Burbury met me and told
me that the Germans had again been giving him trouble. I
was prepared for the news, as I had noticed they were inclined
to shirk work of late, constantly lingering behind and in
every way making themselves objectionable. On an expedition
where there is naturally
plenty of work for every one,
it is useless to have men
who growl at doing their fair
proportion of it. They were
also trying to influence the
other Gauchos, for this trick
of deserting at a critical time,
when their services cannot be
replaced, is a very old one
with <i>peones</i>, who on such occasions
can sometimes force
their employers into giving
them disproportionately high wages. I was, of course, resolved
not to yield to their demands but to push forward, even if they left
us. I consulted with Burbury, who agreed that we could manage
without their help, though it would leave us awkwardly short-handed.</p>

<p>On arriving at the camp I asked the Germans the reason of
their late behaviour, but they could give me no satisfactory answer,
but burst into a tirade about an inoffensive companion, Barckhausen,
which was obviously only an excuse to cover their real
designs. I told them they must in future behave properly or else
leave my camp next morning. After a certain amount of talk and
bluster Fritz said that not only Hollesen and he but the Welsh
<i>peones</i> would in that case turn back.</p>

<p>During the course of the evening I spoke to Jones, who
informed me that Fritz had persuaded him to desert, but on my
pointing out that this would not be a very wise proceeding, he
at once threw in his lot with us.</p>

<p>In the morning, finding I was of the same mind, the Germans
again informed me of their wish to turn back. I therefore gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
them food to last them upon their journey to civilisation, as well
as the worst buck-jumper of the troop, and told them to leave the
camp as soon as possible. Fritz, after some further talk and after
remarking to Hollesen in German that they had better have stayed
after all, climbed on to the horse and rode away.</p>

<p>The Germans at the outset had been admirable workers, apart
from their cunning, which tinged most of their conduct. Yet
perhaps, if they had gone on with us, we might have paid for
Hollesen's misdoings with the Indians, by getting into trouble
with the tribe who had saved his life and whom he had so scurvily
requited. As it happened, a few days later we came upon the very
tribe with whom he had had to do.</p>

<p>I will now take some extracts from my diary:</p>

<p>"<i>October 28.</i>&mdash;The Germans left us this morning. I think we
shall be all the better without them. Immediately on their departure
I determined to march to the <i>cañadon</i> or valley of the River
Senguerr, giving up the route suggested by the Indian, as it was
likely that the horses would stray upon the pampa. It was necessary
to decrease the weight of some of our cargo, which we at once
set about doing. The reason for this was that, having so few men,
each pair of us would have to look after six <i>cargueros</i>, or pack-horses,
and we were consequently obliged to lessen their number.</p>

<p>"While we were getting ready a thin rain and a yelling wind
came down the <i>cañadon</i> as we started to catch the horses. The
salt marsh over which the Germans had gone lay behind us, and
ahead were shallow lagoons around which the tussocks whistled in
the wind. But I think we none of us noticed the inclemency of
the weather, we were soaked to the skin as we worked, and in an
hour and a half&mdash;a record as to time in cargoing up even with the
aid of the men who had gone&mdash;we had loaded the last <i>carguero</i> of
the twelve, and with extra ropes hanging to the saddles, a brandy
bottle protruding from each of the pockets of Barckhausen and
with Jones perched high and stirrupless upon a sack of beans, we
set off."</p>

<p>Providentially, not a single cargo shifted, although we covered
something like fourteen miles. I should have mentioned that one
of the reasons which weighed with me in again seeking the <i>cañadon</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
of the River Senguerr was the fact that four of the horses had
strayed in the night. It was our intention to camp as soon as we
reached a suitable place in the valley and to scour the country for
the lost horses. This, however, turned out not to be necessary, as
we came right upon the truants grazing in the mouth of a small rift
in the cliff of the <i>cañadon</i>. One of
them cantered out with a neigh to
meet the troop upon the hillside.</p>

<p>It rained so heavily in the
night that we put up the tent and
were glad of its warm shelter.
Morning came with pearl-grey
mists in the valley. We worked
like slaves, and our hands became
very sore with the new
cargo-ropes.</p>

<p class="caption">RIVER SENGUERR, WHERE DISASTER OVERTOOK US</p>
</div>

<p>The next day, had I but known it, marked the last of our misfortunes,
for after that we enjoyed as good luck as we had hitherto
experienced the reverse.</p>

<p>We spent most of the morning in slowly marching a couple of
leagues, and then Scrivenor, who was leading, came back to say
that our way was barred by a sheer cliff, close under which the
river ran. Burbury, however, was of the opinion that it would be
easier to proceed than to attempt to scale the tall <i>barranca</i>, which
was our only alternative choice. We straggled across the half-dry
marshy grass that fringed the river-bed, which here winds
greatly.</p>

<p>Presently we climbed on to a steep slope on the cliffs, where
directly below us the river ran with a current of about three knots.
The passage along this slope was very difficult, and we were
driving the horses with infinite care. The face of the cliff was
scarred with the traces of a landslip. One of the horses, the Old
Zaino, so called not because of any weight of years, but on account
of the gravity of his demeanour, climbed up and up, in spite of
all our efforts, among the shifting earth and loose stones until he
was some hundred feet above the main body of the troop. He
was a tall, ewe-necked animal, and always bore an exasperating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
expression of insulted dignity. He was carrying a cargo of
flour.</p>

<p>When he had, in his own opinion, managed to get sufficiently
ahead of his companions, he stopped dead and looked down upon
us with a baleful eye as we toiled beneath him. Then suddenly,
but methodically, he began to
descend towards us in a succession
of devastating bucks.
No cargo, tied with ropes,
could withstand such treatment.
The <i>cinch</i> gave way,
and he and his pack arrived
simultaneously in the middle
of the troop.</p>

<img src="images/i_096.jpg" width="371" height="263" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE OLD ZAINO</p>
</div>

<p>He cannoned against a
black horse carrying ammunition
and oatmeal, and it
began to slide down the cliff towards the river on its haunches.
The remainder of the horses stampeded, some fell, some got
into impossible positions.... For several minutes the big
black horse hung within measurable distance of violent death
upon the rocks below, but Barckhausen made a great effort to save
him, and succeeded, though the cargo was kicked off in a most
perilous place. Only a guanaco track led along the steep hillside,
and over the edge of the slope our belongings dropped into the
river a hundred feet below. Each lifted a small cloud of spray as
it fell and floated serenely away on the current or sank from sight.
The water was dotted with the various packages. All Burbury's
clothes, some of mine, flour, oatmeal, a case of corned beef, six
hundred rounds of ammunition, and the concertina&mdash;these were
among our losses.</p>

<p>A salvage-party was at once despatched to attempt the rescue
of such of our goods as were still swimming, while the rest of us
collected the horses and returned with a sufficiency of ropes to
enable us to get down the cliff, for upon the ragged edge left by
the landslip and overhanging the river some of our things had
lodged. We felt that we were for the time being out of luck.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
We had not long lost the waggon, and now followed the losing of
important stores and the yet more important ammunition. We
knotted together eight of the cargo-ropes, and while Scrivenor and
I were doing this, Barckhausen retrieved one of the boxes of
ammunition, and told us that there were a couple more farther
down, and out of reach, he
feared, which had stuck in
the soft earth of the landslip.
However, with the aid of
the rope I managed to bring
both up to safe ground.</p>

<p class="caption">THE GUANACO (AN INTIMATE OF THE OLD ZAINO'S)</p>
</div>

<p>"During this time we
could see Burbury and Jones
far away in the valley, where
the river narrowed and the
current swinging near the
bank offered a hopeful chance
of catching the floating articles.
They succeeded in
dragging ashore most of the packages, but Burbury's clothes,
which were in a brown waterproof bag, sank, the bag, I fancy,
having filled with water. Our total losses thus amounted to
200 12-bore cartridges, a tin of Mauser ammunition, a 25-kilo
bag of oatmeal, and the clothes. On the whole we could not help
thinking things might have been very much worse.</p>

<p>"The horses had meantime come to a standstill in a patch
of high grass farther along beneath the <i>barranca</i>, and there we
rounded them up and re-cargoed.</p>

<p>"When this was done it was found that we had another place,
almost as difficult as that upon which we had come to grief, to
surmount. This time, however, Burbury led a horse in front,
and the others followed meekly in his track. We had wasted
several hours in negotiating the first <i>barranca</i>, and it was soon
time to camp. As we had no meat, I went to see if I could
not kill some geese (<i>Chloephaga magellanica</i>), which I had
observed upon a neck of land, that stretched out into the
river. There were five geese, and I was lucky enough to kill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
two, both females, which are very much more tender than the
males. On one side of the camp was a chain of small lagoons,
evidently formed by the overflow of the river, and in one of these
I saw a flock of brown pintails. These were easily stalked behind
the rushes, and the discharge of two barrels of the 12-bore left five
upon the water. At dark a
storm of rain blew up.</p>

<p class="caption">THE ALAZAN COLT (NEARLY KILLED ON THE SENGUERR)</p>
</div>

<p>"<i>October 30.</i>&mdash;This cargoing
work is very wearisome,
and has got upon our
nerves. Even in one's sleep
one sees the reeling, writhing
mass of kicking and struggling
<i>cargueros</i> on the white
and ragged-sided <i>barranca</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Got off at 10.30 and reached
the River Mayo, a very small
stream here, flowing through
a wide valley lined by bare
steep cliffs 200 feet or so in height. We are all becoming quite
expert with the cargoes; Burbury and Barckhausen, and Jones
and I work in pairs. The newness has now worn off the ropes,
and hauling on them does not any longer cut our hands. Still
an occasional cargo shifts, and the horse, wildly refusing to be
caught, gallops away kicking at his cargo. Thus did the Alazan
to-day, scattering Mauser ammunition among the bushes, and
kicking the spout from our last kettle, so that we can only fill
it half full.</p>

<p>"There is comparatively little game in this bit of country, few
guanaco, and those very wild because of the Indians, whose beat
we are now approaching. When there is rain, which fortunately
is not often, we have to carry our change of clothing upon our
saddles to dry them. To-day Jones was very much loaded up
with his extra breeches and top boots, that were wet, a gun-cover,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
fifty rounds of ammunition dropped by the Alazan, two ducks, a
telescope, and a water-bottle!</p>

<p>"<i>October 31.</i>&mdash;Soon after we started a big cloud blew out of the
south and brought with it a heavy hailstorm, which whistled before
a driving wind. The horses would not face it, but huddled together
in the centre of the valley. We encamped early as we needed
meat. Jones and I left the camp here among the sand-dunes
in the valley and went a-hunting. We rode up a <i>cañadon</i>, in
the centre of which our horses foundered in some very bad
ground. Getting out of this we struck a stretch of desolate
pampa, across which we cut towards the big <i>cañadon</i> of the Mayo
in order to explore the route which we must follow upon the
morrow. To my surprise we presently came to a clear stream,
flowing through another wide <i>cañadon</i>, which joined the Mayo
from a south-westerly direction. Can this be the River Genguel?
The Indian guide told us that it would take us a month to get from
here to Lake Buenos Aires. If it is the Genguel, however, we
should arrive at the lake in ten marches&mdash;a very different matter.
It would be as well to halt to-morrow for the day, so that an
observation may be taken to determine this point, and also to
enable us to go hunting, as we have but one duck in the camp,
and, since our losses at the Senguerr <i>barranca</i>, it is more than ever
necessary to save our stock of tinned provisions.</p>

<p>"To-day the Old Zaino, this time fortunately not carrying a
cargo, again attempted to repeat his trick of the Senguerr
<i>barranca</i>, but was circumvented by Burbury and Barckhausen.</p>

<p>"<i>November 1.</i>&mdash;To-day Scrivenor shot the sun 70° 56´ W.
long, and 45° 39´ S. lat. So the river we saw yesterday is the
Genguel, which is excellent. Jones and I went out to shoot for the
pot. As there were no guanaco in the neighbourhood, he took the
Paradox and I my 12-bore, and we confined ourselves to
following some flocks of upland geese which we had observed in
the valley. I will describe the day's sport at length, as it was
very typical of Patagonian wild-fowl shooting in a fairly good
district.</p>

<p>"We rode our horses, of course, I taking the Cruzado and
Jones 'J.V.E.' a small brown animal, so called because he bears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
that brand upon his flank. The first geese we came upon were a
party of five standing upon an island in the Mayo. As it was
impossible to stalk these birds we tried driving, and I sent
Humphrey Jones, who, by the way, was a very keen sportsman, to
attempt to drive them over me, where I had taken up my
quarters in some bushes upstream above them on the bank.
Jones meantime made a large circle and galloped up towards
them. When he was within about 200 yards they rose, and
honking indignantly made straight up in my direction, flying,
however, a little too wide. They went down again about a
quarter of a mile away, and we repeated our tactics, I remaining
where I was. I could not help thinking how much time was
saved by Jones being on horseback. Had he been on foot it
would have taken him a long time in that bare valley to fetch
a circle big enough. As it was, in five minutes the birds were
again on the wing, and this time they gave me a chance and I
brought down two; one, however, falling on the other side of the
river, had to be abandoned."</p>

<p>Any one who travels through Patagonia cannot fail to be struck
by the enormous quantities of upland geese (<i>Chloephaga magellanica</i>)
which abound in the vicinity of the rivers and lagoons. At
this time a great many of the birds are paired, but at a latter date
in the valley of the Coyly we once made a camp round which the
country in all directions was covered by thousands of these geese.
After our shot Jones rejoined me and we proceeded to the edge of
a small lagoon, where he told me he had seen some ducks. On
approaching it I examined the birds through my telescope and
discovered them to be brown pintails (<i>Dafila spinicauda</i>). I held
the horses while Jones enjoyed the stalk, which ended in his
killing two of the birds, to retrieve which it was necessary to wade
into pretty deep water.</p>

<p>We now rode towards the valley of the Genguel, and there
flushed innumerable snipe, at which we did not shoot, as we could
not afford to waste ammunition on so small a bird. We next
descried a flock of nineteen geese, which were peculiarly wideawake
and would not allow us to approach for a long time, and presently
we deserted their pursuit in favour of that of a single old gander
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
that was standing upon the shingle beside the river. I got up
quite close to this bird and had a rising shot at him as he flew
across the stream. I killed him quite dead, but it seemed
impossible to retrieve him, and we were rather disconsolately
watching his body drift away when it struck us that Jones, who
was very clever with the lasso, might manage to recover it at a
point where the current brought it within reach of our side. We
therefore galloped parallel to the bird along the bank, and after
one or two ineffectual efforts, Jones succeeded in getting the lasso
round him, and so dragged him in.</p>

<img src="images/i_101.jpg" width="550" height="410" alt="" />
<p class="caption">WILDGOOSE CAMP</p>
</div>

<p>"We next had lunch which consisted of <i>maté</i>. As we sat
waiting for the kettle to boil, several blue-winged teal (<i>Querquedula
cyanoptera</i>) passed over us and went down in a small marsh
towards the Genguel. After these Jones had another stalk, and
killed two. As he was returning a couple of geese flew over at about
thirty-five yards distance, and he dropped the female quite dead.
It is extraordinary what an amount of shot these geese will in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
general way carry off with them. For all my shooting in
Patagonia I used No. 4 shot and 26 gr. of ballistite. The gun
which I used most was a 12-bore moderately choked in both
barrels, and this I found answered every purpose of wild-fowl
shooting in Patagonia excellently.</p>

<p class="caption">BAD STALKING (CALIFATE-BUSH ON PAMPA)</p>
</div>

<p>"At reasonable ranges a number of black-necked swans
(<i>Cygnus nigricollis</i>) fell to this weapon.</p>

<p>"After picking up the goose, we again turned our attention
to the nineteen that I have mentioned earlier. They then went
on a good distance downstream, and here, under cover of the
rushes, we stalked up within twenty yards of them, and shot three
as they rose. One of the flock swung back, and both of us fired at
him, bringing him down. Thinking we had enough geese, we
decided to follow the ducks, which we did in a rather desultory
manner. We bagged two more, both pintails, before we returned
to camp in the evening, having had a very pleasant day's sport."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<p>Although I never attempted to make a big bag upon any day
during the time I spent in Patagonia, yet, no doubt, an enormous
quantity of geese could be shot in a single day. Quite close to the
settlements a couple of hundred might be secured by two guns in
a day, and during the migration a far greater number.</p>

<p>The whole of the valley of the River Chico is excellent for
wild-fowling, and I expected the numbers of birds to increase as
we drew nearer to Lake Buenos Aires. And certainly in the
<i>cañadon</i> of the River Deseado I was not disappointed, but of that
I will write in its due place.</p>

<p>On November 2 we resumed our march, still following the
valley of the Mayo, past the scenes of our sport of the previous
day. A little after midday Jones saw a whitish object among
some bushes at the edge of the river and asked my leave to go
and see what it was. Presently he came riding back to say it
was a wild cow and that he had observed her through the glasses.
She was nearly a mile distant, and, taking my rifle, I rode off
with Jones and we stalked her to about 200 yards. We again
examined her carefully through the telescope, and seeing that she
was five or six years old and unbranded, the fact of her belonging
to a wild herd rather than being a truant escaped from the settlements
two hundred miles away appeared to be certain. It was with
considerable keenness that we crawled up nearer, as wild cattle
afford the best sport of all Patagonian animals.</p>

<p>These wild cattle have some of them been wild for many
generations, their remote ancestors probably being the herds which
the Spaniards originally possessed in the Valdez Peninsula on the
east coast during the earlier occupation of Patagonia. Since then
from time to time numbers of cattle escape from the coast-farms
and run wild, and, joining the older free herds, breed wild. Such
herds are still to be found in considerable numbers among the
foot-hills of the Cordillera. Musters in his book gives an account
of meeting with a wild bull. "We had expected before reaching
this point to have found cattle in considerable numbers, but
the warmth of the day had probably driven them into the thickets
to seek shelter..... Presently ... after riding about a mile, I
espied two bulls. Two men were sent round to endeavour to drive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
the animals to a clearing where it would be possible to use the
lassoo.... At the end of five minutes ... a yell from the
other side put us anxiously on the alert, and we had the gratification
to see one of the animals coming straight towards our cover.
Alas! just as we were preparing to dash out, he turned on the
edge of the plain, and after charging furiously at his pursuer dashed
into a thicket, where he stood at bay. We immediately closed
round him, and dismounting, I advanced on foot to try and bring
him down with a revolver. Just as I got within half a dozen paces
of him, and behind a bush was quietly taking aim at his shoulder,
the Indians, eager for beef, and safe on their horses at a considerable
distance off, shouted, 'Nearer, nearer!' I accordingly slipped
from my cover, but had hardly moved a pace forward when my
spur caught in a root, and at the same moment <i>el Toro</i> charged.
Entangled with the root, I could not jump on one side as he came
on; so, when within a yard I fired a shot in his face, hoping to
turn him, and wheeled my body at the same instant to prevent his
horns from catching me, as the sailors say, 'broadside on.' The
shot did not stop him, so I was knocked down, and, galloping over
me, he passed on with my handkerchief, which fell from my head,
triumphantly borne on his horns, and stopped a few yards off under
another bush. Having picked myself up and found my legs and
arms all right, I gave him another shot, which, as my hand was
rather unsteady, only took effect in the flank. My cartridges
being exhausted, I returned to my horse and found that, besides
being considerably shaken, two of my ribs had been broken
by the encounter.</p>

<p>"The Indians closed round me, and evinced great anxiety to
know whether I was much hurt. One, more courageous than the
rest, despite the warning of the cacique, swore he would try and
lasso the brute, and, accordingly, approached the infuriated animal,
who for a moment or two showed no signs of stirring; just, however,
as the Indian was about to throw his lasso, it caught in a
branch, and before he could extricate it the bull was upon him.
We saw the horse give two or three vicious kicks as the bull
gored him. At length he was lifted clean up, the fore-legs alone
remaining on the ground, and overthrown, the rider alighting on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
his head in a bush. We closed up and attracted the bull in
another direction, then went to look for the corpse of our comrade,
who, however, to our surprise, issued safe from the bush, where he
had lain quiet and unhurt, though the horse was killed. This
little incident cast a gloom over our day's pleasure, and lost us our
Christmas dinner, as Orkeke ordered a retreat to the spot where
we had left our mantles, although we tried to persuade him to
attack the beast again, or, at any rate, remain and eat some of the
dead horse, and try our luck next day, but he was inflexible....
On our way across the plain previously described, wild cattle were
seen, and one chased; but he, although balled by Orkeke, contrived
to slip the <i>bolas</i>, and escaping to cover, stood to bay, where
he was left master of the field."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_105" id="i_105"></a>
<img src="images/i_105.jpg" width="417" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A DAUGHTER OF THE TOLDOS</p>
</div>

<p>In the present instance, however, nothing at all exciting was in
store for us. My first bullet struck the cow behind the shoulder a
little high, she went down upon her knees, and a second shot
brought her to the ground. On our approaching she staggered to
her feet, whereupon Jones gave her a shot in the brain. We then
set about grallocking and skinning our quarry, and were delighted
to find that she carried a good deal of fat. We were at the
time running very short of this essential article of diet, for, as
has been said, the guanacos supply none at this season of the
year, when they are still in poor condition after the hardships
of the winter.</p>

<p>When we had finished cutting up the meat, we packed it as
well as we could upon our saddles and rode away. The amount
of meat with which we had laden our saddles made them extremely
uncomfortable; this was very much so in my own case, as I was
riding a little black horse whose temper was not of the sweetest,
and which had been but seldom ridden since our start, and was
consequently very fresh and skittish. We had spent a long time
over our task of cutting up the cow, and the troop had gone far
ahead. After riding about an hour we saw a white bull upon the
hillside above us, but on using the telescope perceived it carried a
brand upon its flank. We therefore left it in peace.</p>

<p>A little later, as we were riding under the western <i>barranca</i>
of the <i>cañadon</i> of the River Mayo, we came upon some fairly fresh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
tracks of sheep. This fact, taken in conjunction with the appearance
of the white bull, made me begin to wonder whether it was
possible that the cow I had shot might not prove to be a tame one.
We pushed on more rapidly, the tracks growing sharper and more
distinct. Presently the tracks began to run into beaten lines, and
such always mean in Patagonia that man is not far off. As we
rode we discussed the chances as to who the owners of the sheep
would turn out to be, and this we found sufficiently exciting, as we
had beheld no strange face for many a day.</p>

<p>Very soon, as we rode round a curve of the cliff, we came in
sight of five armadillo-shaped tents lying snugly in the valley.
We had not expected to come upon the Indians, who, so our guide
had told us, were in the valley of the River Mayo, until some time
later, but this was undoubtedly the encampment to which he had
alluded. A number of sheep and of horses, together with a small
herd of cattle, proved them to be an unusually rich tribe.</p>

<p>The remainder of our party, on sighting the huts of the
Tehuelches, had halted and were waiting for my arrival. We
now rode together in the direction of the tents, and, while we
were yet afar off, the hounds about the squat tents broke into a
chorus of barking. As we drew nearer we could see that the tall
figures, wrapped in guanaco-skins, were standing in the openings
of the <i>toldos</i>, on the look-out for the arrival whose presence had
been heralded by the dogs. The sun was setting by this time
over the high cliffs of the <i>cañadon</i>, and the <i>toldos</i> threw lengthened
shadows upon the ground.</p>

<p>When we came within a short distance, the Indians stepped
forward, finely developed men, of a swarthy brown, with high
cheek-bones, their coarse black hair falling round their faces, and
tied about the brows with a red band. The tents seemed to be
full to overflowing of old women and lean hounds, all huddled
together upon the ground, and a crowd of curious faces peeped
forth. The <i>toldos</i> were made of guanaco-skins, sewn loosely at
their edges, and supported squarely on awkward-looking props or
posts, forked at the top to admit the ridge-poles. The skins were
fastened to the earth outside with wooden pegs. These dwellings
appeared to be anything but weather-proof, for at the seams and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
lower edges were gaping slits, through which the sky or the ground
was visible. As to the shape of the <i>toldos</i>, if you can imagine a
very squat, deep-draught boat, cut off at rather beyond the half of
her length, and turned upside down, you will have some idea of
their appearance. On the roof, and about the wooden props,
pieces of guanaco-meat had been hung out to dry in the sun.
Within, as I have said, upon the skins which strewed the floor the
dogs and grandmothers of the tribe were mingled.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_109" id="i_109"></a>
<img src="images/i_109.jpg" width="550" height="418" alt="" />
<p class="caption">WATI! WATI! (TEHUELCHE EXCLAMATION OF SURPRISE)</p>
</div>

<p>It was our first experience of a Tehuelche encampment, and
perhaps the most remarkable feature of it was the presence, in one
form or another, of the guanaco. Some of his flesh was cooking
at a fire outside the tents, the <i>toldos</i> themselves were composed of
his pelts, the ponchos which some of the women were weaving
were made from his wool, the boots were formed of his neck-skin,
some of the horse-gear of his hide, the men's <i>capas</i> of his skin,
while dogs, men, and women alike were fattened upon the food he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
provided. As I stood there, examining all these things, my mind
kept running upon the cow which I had killed, and which I was
now more than half afraid might have belonged to the Indians. If
such proved to be the case, I knew that they would resent it very
bitterly, and even perhaps attempt to make some sort of reprisals
upon our horses. The idea of saying nothing about it, were my surmise
as to the chance of its having been their property correct, struck
me as being the least troublesome course to pursue; but nothing
is more abhorrent than dealing in this way with aboriginal tribes.
Personally, I should look upon picking the pocket of a civilised
person as, in comparison, almost a meritorious action. I may as
well say at once that I told them of the matter of the cow through
the <i>vaqueano</i> or guide whom I hired from their tents, and offered to
pay for it if it happened to be their property. The <i>vaqueano</i>, however,
said that no cow of that colour belonged to their herd, and,
taking into consideration that she was six years old and unmarked,
I made my mind easy on this point.</p>

<p>I shall now break off from the thread of my narrative and
give a description of the Tehuelches, detailing the facts which I
gathered about them during my residence in Patagonia. I will
only preface it by saying that few peoples are more interesting to
study than the Tehuelches, of whom various travellers have given
such widely differing accounts.

<p>Snow lay in the hollows so deep that only the lean crests of the
higher bushes could thrust themselves through its surface. The
wind, which had driven the snowstorm of the morning away to the
east, swept drearily down out of an evening sky where neither sun
nor sunset hues were to be seen, nothing but a spread of cold and
misty grey, growing slowly overshadowed by the looming promise
of more snow.</p>

<p>In the middle of the level white pampa two figures upon
galloping horses were visible. As we came nearer we saw that one
was that of a man clothed in a <i>chiripa</i> and a <i>capa</i> in which brown
was the predominating colour. He was mounted on a heavy-necked
powerful <i>cebruno</i> horse, his stirrups were of silver, and his
gear of raw-hide seemed smart and good. As he rode he yelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
with all his strength, producing a series of the most horrible and
piercing shrieks.</p>

<p>But strange as was this wild figure, his companion, victim or
quarry, was stranger and more striking still. For on an ancient
<i>zaino</i> sat perched a little brown maiden, whose aspect was forlorn
and pathetic to the last degree. She rode absolutely naked in the
teeth of the bitter cold, her breast, face and limbs blotched and
smeared with the rash of some eruptive disease, and her heavy-lidded
eyes, strained and open, staring ahead across the leagues of
empty snow-patched plain.</p>

<p>Presently the man redoubled his howls, and bearing down upon
the <i>zaino</i> flogged and frightened it into yet greater speed. The
whole scene might have been mistaken for some ancient barbaric
and revolting form of punishment; whereas, in real truth, it was
an anxious Indian father trying, according to his lights, to cure his
daughter of the measles!</p>

<p>It appeared that the girl had taken the disease in an extremely
acute form, and Indian belief and reasoning run something on these
lines:</p>

<p>First fact&mdash;The child was possessed by a devil of great power
and ferocity, who set up such a trouble inside her body that it came
forth through her skin in blotches and spots.</p>

<p>Second fact&mdash;A devil is known to dislike noise and cold. All
devils do. Hence the ride of the unlucky patient without a shred
to protect her from the strong west wind snow-fed with bitter cold,
and the almost incredible uproar made by the old gentleman upon
the dark brown horse.</p>

<p>If one concedes the premises, it must be admitted there was
method in his madness.</p>

</div>

<p>The above account was given me by Mr. Ernest Cattle, an
accurate observer, whose knowledge of the wild districts of
Patagonia is unique.</p>

<p>Such is the Tehuelche Indian of Patagonia to-day, and facts
tend to show that he has in very few particulars departed from the
customs, manner of living and modes of thought which distinguished
his forefathers in the dawn of authentic Tehuelchian history. The
earliest mention of the natives of Patagonia occurs on the occasion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
of the discovery of the country by Magellan in 1520. They were
described as men of huge stature, giants in fact, and the very name
Patagonia is said to be derived from the epithet "<i>patagon</i>," or
"large feet," which the Spaniards bestowed upon them on account
of the enormous tracks their footsteps left upon the sand of the seashore.
The Tehuelches are not, as it happens, a large-footed
though they are a tall race, but, considering the curious persistency
of habit, which is one of their chief characteristics, the
idea taken up by the Spanish is easily explained. The Tehuelches
wear boots of <i>potro</i> (colt-skin) or guanaco-skin, which project in a
narrow point some inches beyond the toes. There can be little
doubt, judging by all else we know of them, that their ancestors of
Magellan's day wore the same shape of foot-gear. The impressions
left by such boots would very naturally, on being observed by
voyagers, take their place as indications of a race of giants. In
connection with this idea I may mention that several early writers
united in giving a very bad name to the Tehuelches. No reputation
could be more totally unmerited. From reading such accounts one
would be left with the conviction that the Tehuelches are blood-thirsty
and barbarous savages. This is certainly not the case now,
and I do not believe, judging from all I saw of them under various
circumstances, that such accusations could ever have been deserved.
Some travellers appear to have fallen into the error of confounding
them with other Indian races of South America, whose characteristics
and history differ absolutely from the people of whom I
am writing.</p>

<p>We see here how easy it is for travellers to make mistakes.
More than one writer has charged them with the habit of eating
raw flesh; whereas they cook the meat for food, but on occasion
they will eat raw fat and drink the warm blood of the ostrich,
which facts, no doubt, have given rise to the above misstatement.</p>

<p>Although not giants, the Tehuelches are certainly one of the
finest races in the world. Most of them average 6 ft., some attain
to 6 ft. 4 in. or even more, and in all cases they are well built and
well developed. Physically, the men are splendid fellows, who
look yet more nobly formed and proportioned because of the ample
folds of the skin <i>capas</i> and <i>ponchos</i> in which they wrap themselves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
Their way of life tends to muscular excellence, but even taking
that into consideration the development of the arms, chest, and, in
fact, the whole body above the loins is extraordinary. But the
lower limbs are sometimes disappointing, being, in fact, the lower
limbs of a race of riders.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The Tehuelche Indians of Patagonia are essentially nomads,
living chiefly upon the proceeds of their hunting, and, in a less
degree, maintaining themselves upon sale or barter connected
with their limited holding of domestic animals. Agriculture or
tillage is absolutely unknown among them. The hunting-ground
is farm enough for them, and they pitch their tents of skin where
they will, or change their quarters at the dictates of necessity or
whim. They always break camp if a death occurs among the
tribe, for the spot is then considered accursed. And they are, of
course, also largely influenced in their movements by the wanderings
of the guanaco herds, which form their principal quarry.</p>

<p>There are five existing camps of Indians to be found in
Patagonia. I visited two of them and a third small outlying
group. Their numbers have sadly decreased since the days of the
opening 'seventies, when George Chaworth Musters made his
abode in the tribal <i>toldos</i> and followed with them in their
wanderings. He speaks of two tribes of Tehuelches, the northern
and the southern, only distinguishable by a slight difference of
dialect, and who met and intermarried, although they did not
object to espousing opposite sides in a quarrel. Other tribes
whom he mentions did not inhabit the part of the country of which
I am writing.</p>

<p>The Tehuelches proper appear to have been fairly prosperous
and numerous in his day, but even then he says, speaking of them:
"Supplies of rum procured in trade at the settlements ...
and disease, small-pox especially, are rapidly diminishing their
numbers." Things have undoubtedly gone from bad to worse in
this unhappy direction, and I am inclined to think that the number
of Tehuelche Indians surviving at this period can be little over a
few hundreds in number. Rum is undoubtedly their chief foe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
Drink to the uncivilised man is a danger against which he is provided
with no defence, either social or moral. Having once tasted
its fatal pleasures, he has no reason for forbidding himself an
indulgence his animal nature craves.</p>

<p class="caption">ARROWHEADS AND KNIFE, FOUND NEAR COLOHUAPI, CHUBUT. (NOW IN COLLECTION OF
MR. E. M. SPROT)</p>
</div>

<p>Since the day on which the Spanish adventurers first sighted
the Patagonian coast, perhaps the one "event" in the history of
the Indians may truly be said to be the introduction of horses into
their land. Otherwise they seem to have altered little in their
way of life. Magellan says they came down to the ship clad and
shod in guanaco-skins; they are clad and shod in guanaco-skins
to-day. Their tools and knives were sharp-edged flints; I have
seen the Indians skin their quarry with precisely the same weapons.</p>

<p>Bows and arrows were indeed in use among the tribes when
the Spaniards visited the coast; these have now been superseded
by the <i>boleadores</i>, an innovation which in its present form came
into fashion after the Indians began to know the value of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
horse. The <i>bolas</i> is the weapon of the Tehuelche. With it he
kills his game, and with it also he catches wild colts, and finds it
useful in his simple process of training. The <i>bolas</i> is made up of
three thongs of raw hide fastened together at one end, the other
free ends having attached to them stones or bits of pot-iron sewn
up in skin. The Indian throws his weapon with marvellous
accuracy at any animal he may be pursuing, and the thongs coiling
instantly round the legs or neck of the creature, bring it to the
ground, or, at any rate, entangle it hopelessly.</p>

<p>It may well be judged that this race have no history. They
remain in touch with the methods and customs according to which
their forefathers were wont to live centuries ago, and who in their
turn had derived them from still older generations. Though most
of the men now possess cheap store knives of steel, I have seen, as
I said before, many a quarry skinned with the prehistoric flint
knife. They are an intelligent people, indeed keen where bargaining
is concerned, as long as they are sober; yet they seem to
be entirely lacking in that quality which would enable them to
forget the past with its traditional usages and methods, and to
follow even remotely the sweeping onward rush that, like a tornado,
carries with it the lagging races of mankind. Although the men
possess unusual strength, they do not in the least know how to
apply it. Their faces are somewhat flat, although the features are
more or less cast in the aquiline mould, and fairly regular. The
hair is coarse and lustreless, its blackness relieved by a fillet or
handkerchief of scarlet. Their teeth are excellent, toothache being
almost unknown in their tents. Although they bathe, I have
never observed among them any article that would in any way
correspond to the tooth-stick of other nomadic peoples. Their
beautiful teeth are perhaps due to their habit of chewing a gummy
substance that exudes from the incensio bush. Musters, in his
book, says they use this as a dentifrice.</p>

<p class="caption">A TEHUELCHE CACIQUE</p>
</div>

<p>The women are not, according to our European ideas, beautiful,
and such comeliness as they may sometimes possess in youth
blossoms and fades quickly. They are, however, strong, and
much of the camp work falls to their share. The older women can
boast of a brand of ugliness all their own. Age to these ladies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
brings several vices in its train. Most noticeable is a craving for
strong waters, a weakness from which the younger women are
entirely free.</p>

<p>The morality of the Tehuelches is, on the whole, admirable.
Unfaithfulness in the wife is rare, and not often bitterly revenged.
A point as regards the morality of the women is to my mind rather
luminous. While the younger <i>chinas</i> are unexceptionable in their
moral virtues, the older women cannot be so highly commended.
They are rather apt to wander from the stricter paths of decorum.
When the husband of one of these elderly houris dies, as soon as
the due period of mourning is past, the bereaved one will take up
with any male in her tribe for either a longer or a shorter period.
For ugliness sheer and unrivalled these grandmothers of the
tribes stand alone. Also, as they get on in years, these ladies
often run to fat. I remember one immense woman in the <i>toldos</i> on
the pampas between Lake Argentino and Gallegos, who had put
on flesh in a manner and to an extent almost unbelievable.</p>

<p>The younger women, while the flush of girlhood is still upon
them, possess a certain comeliness which I can only describe by
the adjectives "savage" and "stolid." Yet the abundant coarse black
hair hanging round the heavily quiet faces, in which the features,
though flattened, are still slightly aquiline, the wide-open, patient
eyes, the healthful colour, and the strong, white, even teeth, which
their slow smiles disclose to you, make them, on the whole, a
personable race.</p>

<p>The half-bloods, as is usual, often possess real beauty, the
alien strain giving them that vivacity which the pure race seems
to lack.</p>

<p>Some of the pictures show an unsightly slit of the lip in the
case of a few <i>paisanos</i>.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This hare-lip is by no means universal,
but is an hereditary peculiarity that appears in many of the
members of one special household. The arrival of a stranger
in the camp makes the women retire shyly within themselves,
and it is only by chance&mdash;as it is in the case of wild animals&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
the new-comer ever sees the unaffected and natural character
shine out. When in contact with whites the Tehuelche man also
becomes reserved, the whole expression of his countenance
changes, and he is very suspicious of being laughed at, a point
on which he is very susceptible, and which he deeply resents.</p>

<p>I cannot but think that the constant accusations of uncleanliness
that have been brought against the Tehuelche Indians
are due to the single fact that their dogs are allowed to live
in the <i>toldos</i>. The result in a country where scab is common
may be left to the imagination. But, apart from the crawling
things which inhabit his <i>toldos</i>, the Indian is fairly cleanly,
bathing each day and swimming in the lakes and lagoons. The
women make excellent mothers, and the father is inordinately
proud of his offspring, especially of his sons. Of how many
races can so many good things be truthfully said?</p>

<p>They have a singular custom of bandaging the heads of
infants in such a manner as to produce a flattening of the back
of the skull. It might be worth the while of physiologists to
go deeper into the matter, with a view to discovering how far this
alteration in the brain-space determines the character of the individual
operated upon. Interesting results might thus be obtained
and some vexed problems solved.</p>

<p>A certain stage in the life of each girl is celebrated by a
festivity in the camp. An ornamented <i>toldo</i> is put up temporarily
for the girl's occupation, and the young men of the tribe march
round it singing while the women howl, probably with a view
to exorcising any evil spirit who may be lingering about the
camp.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The ceremony is followed by a feast, and the evening
winds up with a dance. The men alone take part in this, and
it consists in circling round the fire, pacing sometimes slowly
and sometimes quickly. A few dance at a time, accompanying
their movements with a constant bowing or nodding of the
head, which is adorned with tufts of ostrich feathers. When
one party is tired out another takes its place.</p>

<p>Wives, of course, are bought and sold, but when a lady is
purchased by a suitor whom she happens to dislike, there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
trouble for the bridegroom, and conjugal obedience is only
enforced after struggles, of which the not infrequent result is that
the mark of the lady's teeth remains permanently upon her lord.</p>

<p>The price of a wife varies, as must be expected in the natural
course of things. Strangely enough, a girl's value often depends upon
the number of her brethren, who must receive two horses apiece.
To buy a bride with means or rather animals of her own, an heiress
in fact, who comes of well-to-do people, as much as a hundred
mares have been given&mdash;or shall I say paid.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>When desirous of carrying on matrimonial negotiations the
would-be bridegroom must always employ a go-between. To omit
this ceremonial method of approach would be an outrage on
etiquette. I conclude, though I do not know it for a fact as regards
Patagonia, that the go-between in that country gets his pickings
from both sides as his congener does elsewhere.</p>

<p>The marriage ceremony is delightfully simple. After the preliminary
bargaining has been successfully brought to a close, the
happy bridegroom mounts his horse and rides to the <i>toldo</i> of his
intended and hands over his appointed gifts, receiving those of the
parents in return. He then carries back his bride amid the cheers
and cries of his friends, and in the evening there is a feast.
Musters remarks that on these occasions the dogs are not permitted
to touch the meat or offal of the animals killed, as it is considered
unlucky if they do so.</p>

<p>The gifts which are exchanged between the parties form in a
more or less degree a marriage settlement, for in case of divorce
her parents' gifts accrue to the wife. Polygamy is allowed but not
much practised among the tribes.</p>

<p>Few phenomena are to my mind more unaccountable than the
action of the white man who "goes fantee."</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Went fantee, joined the people of the land,</p>
<p>Turned three parts Mussulman and one Hindoo,</p>
<p>And lived among the Gauri villages,</p>
<p>Who gave him shelter and a wife or twain."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<p>This singular mental or moral warp which results in a man
"going fantee" is by no means uncommon in Patagonia. Of
course, as may be imagined, a certain proportion of such men fall
to this condition at the end of the career variegated. Others
prefer ruling in Cathay to serving in any other community more
dignified; others again take daughters of the land to wife because
their trade lies with the Indians.</p>

<p>There is, however, one very strong objection to this latter
course of marrying, Tehuelche fashion, a <i>china</i> of the <i>toldos</i>,
and that is that all the relatives of the lady in question are apt to
quarter themselves upon the bridegroom. Occasionally the white
man objects, but I imagine that the cases of those who object successfully
are rare. But there is one <i>estanciero</i> in Patagonia who is
the father of two buxom daughters by a Tehuelche wife. These
girls are now grown up, and their tribe was encamped during the
winter of 1900 not two hours' ride from the dwelling-place of their
father. Yet I am assured the father never aided the tribe or his
own offspring in any way, although that winter was so severe that
starvation visited the <i>toldos</i> of the tribe. A man of this mettle is,
however, not frequently to be heard of, and cases of a quite laudable
affection having existed between a white man and a <i>china</i> are
on record.</p>

<p>But, at the same time, it must be repeated that the influence of
the white who goes to live among the Indians as one of themselves,
almost without exception, makes for evil. I have already spoken
of the offspring of the mixed unions. The Tehuelche blood gives
to the faces of the half-breed women an expression of sad patience,
while the Spanish connection adds certainly to their gift of beauty.</p>

<p class="caption">TEHUELCHE MATRON, SHOWING HARE-LIP</p>
</div>

<p>The women have very simple ideas of adornment. They
generally take the form of silver necklets and the red fillet bound
in their hair.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Their dress is composed of the picturesque guanaco-skin
<i>capa</i>, or mantle, worn with the wool inside. Woman, to tell the
truth, holds no such bad position among the Patagonian Indians.
She does the cooking, but little else that can be called hard work,
except the taking down and pitching of the <i>toldos</i> when the tribe
break camp. They carry on a slack industry in the form of weaving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
<i>ponchos</i> from guanaco wool. Some species of earth is used for
dyeing the wool, but the resulting colours are dull. In this particular
the Tehuelches differ from the Indians of the northern
pampas, whose dyeing materials are derived from herbs, and give
brighter tints. These <i>ponchos</i> and saddle-rugs made by the <i>chinas</i>
are much prized and sought after as curiosities, hence the makers
demand very high prices for them&mdash;even up to thirty or forty
dollars each.</p>

<p>The women also spend some of their time in sewing together
the skins of guanaco or ostriches into rugs, using sinews for
thread. Rugs of this kind and bunches of ostrich feathers form
the staple commodities which they offer at the settlements for sale.</p>

<p>The hair of the adult animal, being harsh and coarse, is of less
value in the market than that of the young guanaco; therefore
the hunters endeavour to secure chiefly the pelts of the young
guanaco, some of the rugs being even made from the skin of the
unborn, which is cut out of the mother a few days previous to
the date when they would naturally be dropped. At certain
seasons enormous numbers of these pelts are to be seen drying,
pegged out, beside the Indian <i>toldos</i>.</p>

<p>The time of year during which the hunting of guanaco <i>chicos</i>,
or little ones, is carried on includes the latter half of October and
the month of November.</p>

<p>I am afraid it must be confessed that the Tehuelches are a very
lazy race. Nearly everything which makes any demand upon their
energies&mdash;with the exception of hunting&mdash;seems too much trouble
for them to do. Few individuals become even comparatively rich,
and even then live none the better for it. One could never guess
whether a man were rich or poor by his dress; he carries no sign
of improved circumstances in his person or bearing. The owner
of two thousand beasts will come into camp and sit by your fire,
putting in a plea with the humblest for a cupful of <i>maté</i>. Occasionally
an Indian will act as a guide across the empty distances
of the pampas. They have an excellent idea of the value of their
services and of the paper <i>peso</i> of the Argentine Republic. They
set a high price upon themselves&mdash;a <i>vaqueano</i>, or guide, demanding
five dollars a day or seventy dollars a month.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>But however this quality may seem to approximate to civilisation,
the customs with which he still surrounds the events of birth,
sickness, and death are the old cruel forms that have been perpetuated
through the ages, and they stamp him as remaining even
to this day the very slightly diluted savage.</p>

<p>In some cases when a child is born, a cow or mare is killed,
the stomach taken out and cut open, and into this receptacle while
still warm the child is laid. Upon the remainder of the animal
the tribe feast, and when they feast they carry out the notion
thoroughly. After eating their fill, they lie about gorged and half
insensible and let the world spin on. This is a quiet festivity, and
only takes place in this modified form when the tribe happen to
be out of fire-water.</p>

<p>But should there be liquor at hand, the younger women, who
never drink on such occasions, go round beforehand and gather up
every knife, hatchet, or, in fact, all and any weapon they can find,
and bury them in some hidden spot about the camp.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> This
custom, which is in its own way pathetic, speaks for itself. Under
the influence of liquor the nature of the peaceable Indian becomes
completely changed. It maddens him, and the dance round the
fires often ends in a free fight.</p>

<p>A variation of the foregoing birth-ceremony is yet more savage.
If a boy is born, his tribe catch a mare or a colt&mdash;if the father be
rich and a great man among his people, the former; if not, the
latter&mdash;a lasso is placed round each leg, a couple round the neck,
and a couple round the body. The tribe distribute themselves
at the various ends of these lassos and take hold. The animal
being thus supported cannot fall. The father of the child now
advances and cuts the mare or colt open from the neck downwards,
the heart, &amp;c., is torn out, and the baby placed in the
cavity. The desire is to keep the animal quivering until the child
is put inside. By this means they believe that they ensure the
child's becoming a fine horseman in the future.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>If an Indian dies the place becomes accursed. The camp is
immediately removed to a fresh locality. When the dead man or
woman is buried, certain ceremonies are observed about the grave,
evidently with a view to enabling the departed to start in another
life with an adequate outfit. Horses and dogs are slaughtered,
so that he may have the means to pursue and kill the guanaco in
the land of ghosts. Food and dead game are also placed in the
grave to supply his needs at the outset of the new existence.
Should the dead happen to be a child or a person of tender years,
fillies and colts are slaughtered at the burial.</p>

<p>In former times, and in fact until quite recent years, it used to
be the custom to place beside the corpse the silver-mounted horse-gear
of the dead man, and to close the grave upon it. In a land
where life depends not infrequently upon the strength of your raw-hide
head-stall, for instance, the value of sound gear is properly
appreciated; therefore this particular precaution for the welfare of
the dead shows a very practical solicitude on the part of the survivors.
To-day the Tehuelches still bury these possessions in the
grave, but the custom is only continued with a reservation. Instead
of leaving the valuable gear under the earth for all time,
they now at the end of a twelvemonth dig it up again. How
they reconcile this economical arrangement with the comfort of
their lost friend I do not know, but it may be suggested that they
imagine the inhabitant of another world has had full time in the
course of a year to make suitable new gear for himself.</p>

<p>The religion of the Indians is interesting. It consists, of
course, in the old simple beliefs in good spirits and devils, but
chiefly devils, which, with variations dependent on climate and
physical environment, represent all over the world the spiritual
creeds of uncivilised races. The dominant Spirit of Evil, as feared
by the Tehuelches, is called the Gualicho. And he abides as an
ever-present terror behind their strange, free, and superstitious
lives. They spend no small portion of their time in either fleeing
from his wrath or in propitiating it. You may wake in the dawn
to see a band of Indians suddenly rise and leap upon their horses,
and gallop away across the pampa, howling and gesticulating.
They are merely scaring the Gualicho away from their tents back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
to his haunts in the Cordillera&mdash;the wild and unpenetrated mountains,
where he and his subordinate demons groan in chosen spots
the long nights through.</p>

<p>The expedition under my command happened to encamp near
one such place upon the southern shore of Lake Rica. It was a
moonlight night, and loud rushing noises broke the peace of every
hour of it. There happened to be a huge glacier on the opposite
side of the lake, from which great pieces became detached at
frequent intervals (for the mass of the glacier overhung the cliff),
and these plunged with strange, loud explosions, I might almost
call them, into the water. Such are the noises that terrify the
Indian; he cannot explain them, and it is small wonder they excite
his fears in the highest degree. For it must be remembered that
in all practical ways the Tehuelche is a very brave man. Yet no
pay can tempt him within the region of the Cordilleras, where to
his superstitious mind the near presence of the Gualicho is manifested
by those awful groanings and sounds which no human
agency known to him could by any possibility produce.</p>

<p>In common with other savage peoples, the Tehuelches believe
the Good Spirit to be of a far more quiescent habit than the spirits
of evil. Long ago, at the epoch of Creation perhaps, the Good
Spirit made one effort for the benefit of mankind,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> but since then he
has been otherwise occupied, and shown himself little interested
with earthly matters. Like Baal, he is perchance upon a journey,
or perchance he is sleeping. The result is the same; his
worshippers must take care of themselves as well as they can, and
the best method which offers is to ward off by all means in their
power the attacks of the maleficent influence. For the Gualicho
is of a very active disposition, and shows no scorn of small
things. On the contrary, he is quite capable of descending upon
a single Indian to punish him for an offence and to work him
harm.</p>

<img src="images/i_131.jpg" width="550" height="487" alt="" />
<p class="caption">CHILDREN OF THE TOLDOS</p>
</div>

<p>It is a humiliating reflection that the great mass of peoples have
always been, and will always be, far more ready and fervent in
propitiating an evil spirit, or endeavouring to avert the action of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
any punishing power, than in seeking the favour of the Good
Spirit or returning him thanks for benefits received. Human
nature under the frock-coat of civilisation is much the same as
under the <i>capa</i> of the Tehuelche.</p>

<p>By inference one can see that the Patagonian believes in a
future life&mdash;a life much on the lines of his earthly one, but
abounding in those things which he most desires, and which here
he finds in short measure. I only know that the land he is going
to after death is a land flowing, not with milk and honey, but with
grease. On the pampas of life here below the guanaco is lean and
seldom yields an ounce of fat, and as I have myself experienced
the craving for fat, or fat-hunger, I know it to be a very real and
uncomfortable demand of the human system. But in the
Patagonian Beyond the guanaco herds will be plump and well
provided with supplies of suet, and the califate-bushes always laden
with ripe and purple berries.</p>

<p>The traditions of the tribes go back to the epoch when
they hunted on foot and used bows and arrows, as well as the
<i>bolas</i>, armed with a large single ball of stone. That period may
be one hundred, or possibly a hundred and fifty, years ago.
Then a tribe of Pampa Indians rode down out of the north and
brought to the Tehuelches the inestimable boon of horses.</p>

<p>At the present day no worse evil can happen to an Indian
than to be left without a horse and dependent on his own legs.
He rides perpetually, and in consequence has almost lost the
walking capabilities of other men.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> He lives upon horseback, and
there earns his living, so to speak. With his dogs he rides down
his game, but he has no skill in tracking any more than the dogs.
But, for all that, his sight is keen; the quality of extraordinary
long-sightedness, which distinguishes men used to scanning vast
levels of sea or land, is essentially his.</p>

<p>The Tehuelche, although in many ways offering a complete
contrast, yet in some points forms a strange parallel to the Esquimaux.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
The Esquimaux has never seen a horse, the Tehuelche
never uses a boat, although his land abounds in sheets of water.
Both races are eminently sluggish and peaceable. Both fear evil
spirits, which they fancy live in particular localities. It is indeed
a far cry from Greenland to Patagonia, but if you substitute the
horse for the kayak and the seal for the guanaco, you will find that,
although separated by space and race and circumstance, a certain
resemblance between the people of the Far South and of the Far
North exists. And of both races little evil can be said.</p>

<p>These primitive peoples, living close to nature, divided from
man's original state only by the thinnest and filmiest of partitions,
attain in a wonderful degree the art of doing without things. The
Esquimaux starts upon a long day's hunting, with the thermometer
marking many degrees below zero, upon nothing save a drink of
water! A luxury such as coffee is said to enervate him.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The
Patagonian Indian rides out of a morning having taken nothing at
all in the way of sustenance. But he puts a pinch of salt in his
belt, and when his dogs pull down their first guanaco or ostrich,
he draws off the blood and swallows it mixed with salt.</p>

<p>The tribes live to a considerable extent on guanaco, and it is
practically their life-work to follow the wanderings of the herds
through the changing seasons. But the flesh of the ostrich is
more palatable, and is, consequently, preferred when it can be procured.
They drink <i>maté</i> in large quantities, which, as has been
shown, is the universal habit on the pampas, where it is, in fact,
indispensable, supplying, as it does, to a certain extent, the place
of vegetables, besides having the valuable quality of refreshing
and invigorating in a quite extraordinary degree.</p>

<p>They rarely smoke pure tobacco; it is too precious. They
mix it with about 80 per cent. of califate-wood shavings. Once,
when short of tobacco, I tried their mixture, and in truth there are
many worse smokes upon the English and American markets.
The califate is certainly a little acrid, but burns with a very blue
smoke. I fancy one could get on tolerably well with this faked
tobacco, aided by a bit of imagination and a strong throat.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_135" id="i_135"></a>
<img src="images/i_135.jpg" width="458" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">TEHUELCHE MATRONS</p>
</div>

<p>For the most part the tribes use stone pipes of a very singular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
coffin-like shape. One Indian, however, possessed a silver pipe,
the stem of which had begun life as a <i>bombilla</i>, or silver tube for
drinking <i>maté</i> through. Musters mentions frequently seeing the
men become insensible after smoking, which would lead to the
supposition that they use some drug corresponding in its effects to
opium. I never observed a single instance of this sort, although I
smoked the camp-fire pipe on many occasions with Tehuelches.
In fact, of those I met, two out of three were not smokers
at all.</p>

<p>The language of these people is very guttural, and one word
is used to signify a number of different things, which proves its
elementary and simple character. In most of their camps Spanish
is understood more or less, and with even a slight knowledge of this
tongue one can get on very well.</p>

<p>Practically the Patagonian is governed by no tribal laws. He
does not need their restraint, for, save when drunk, he seldom
commits crimes of greater or less magnitude. In politics he is
democratic apparently, for though it is true that a <i>cacique</i> is at the
head of each camp, his authority seems limited to ordering the plan
of the hunt. If any individual objects he can leave the community,
an alternative extremely distasteful to so gregarious a people.
Quarrels and fights are of very rare occurrence, except when there is
drink in the tents. The natural peacefulness of the Indian is certainly
commendable, for his muscular development is enormous. He
can tear the skin from a guanaco after merely raising enough with
his knife to give him a hand-grip.</p>

<p>Once it was a free and a happy life that they lived, with fortunes
ruled by the changing of the seasons. In those days, five-and-twenty
years ago, they were scattered throughout the country,
moving along the Indian trail. Now, in the whole of my long
travel through Patagonia, I came upon only three encampments
of them, and I have reason to believe I visited nearly every one
that exists at the present day. It is probable that I may be their
last chronicler; they will be brushed off the face of the earth by
the sweeping besom that deals so hardly with aboriginal races, and
is known as "civilisation."</p>

<p>The cause of their disappearance is not far to seek. You may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
dust a savage people with Martinis and increase their manhood,
if the punishment be not severe and too prolonged, but as sure as
the whisky bottle&mdash;the raw, cheap, rot-gut country spirit&mdash;is
introduced among them, a primitive people is doomed. In all sorts
of places in the world I have seen this baleful influence at work.</p>

<p>The Indians, as I knew them, are a kind-hearted, docile and
lazy race. In all the dealings I had with them I found them
invariably most courteous. Treat them as you desire they should
treat you, and not in the odious "poor-devil-of-a-heathen, beast-of-a-savage"
sort of style, which obtains with some of our own
countrymen abroad, I am sorry to say, and you will receive a grave
and quiet consideration, and they will call you <i>buen hombre</i>, a good
man.</p>

<p>Progress, the white man's shibboleth, has no meaning for the
Patagonian. He is losing ground day by day in the wild onward
rush of mankind. Our ideas do not appeal to him. He has
neither part nor lot in the feverish desires and ambitions that move
us so strongly. As his forefathers were, so is he&mdash;content to live
and die a human item with a moving home, passing hither and
thither upon the waste and open spaces of his native land. He is
far too single-minded and too dignified to stoop to a cheap imitation.
He does not shout aloud that he is the equal of the white
man, as more vulgar races do. It has often struck me that the
primitive races of the world might be put under two heads&mdash;the
men of silence and the men of uproar. Among the men of silence
we have the Zulu, the North American Indian, the Tehuelche, and
some others. These silent peoples cannot exist, like the negroes,
as the camp followers of civilisation. They have not the ya-hoop
imitative faculty of the negro race. They are hunters, men of
silence and of a great reserve. When they meet with the white
man, they do not rush open-mouthed to swallow his customs.</p>

<p>The men of silence will, in the savage state, take a hint as
quickly as an English gentleman; the men of uproar will only
accept a hint when it is backed by a command. The Tehuelche
will not remain at a camp-fire where he is not wanted. He lacks
passion, perhaps, but appreciation pleases him. His dignified
courtesy can best be exemplified by a story.

<p class="caption">A TEHUELCHE BEAUTY</p>
</div>

<p>At one time, while we were travelling across the pampas and
had camped for the night, an Indian rode in upon us in the twilight.
The Indian did not talk Spanish, nor could we speak Tehuelchian.
In silence he joined us at our evening meal and stopped afterwards
to smoke a pipe of tobacco, then he got to horse and rode
away.</p>

<p>The next morning our horses were missing; they had evidently
strayed during the night. I went out to look for them, and after a
time saw them far away across the pampa advancing towards me
in a compact mob. A rider was driving them up. As soon as he
saw me, and I had recognised our guest of the preceding evening,
he sent forward the horses at a gallop in my direction, and, wheeling
round, was off and out of sight in a moment. He did not wait
to be thanked, and yet it was obvious, from the condition of the
horses, that he must have found them a long way off and driven
them for a considerable distance. It is in courtesies of this kind
that the silent peoples excel.</p>

<p>I am no wild admirer of the noble savage. He is, generally
speaking, a highly objectionable person. But to see a race&mdash;so
kindly, picturesque, and gifted with fine qualities of body and
mind&mdash;such as the Tehuelches, absolutely at hand-grips with
extinction, seems to me one of the saddest results of the growing
domination of the white man and his methods of civilisation.

</p>

<p>During the latter half of October and during November, which
is the Patagonian spring, the Tehuelches hunt the guanaco <i>chicos</i>,
or young guanaco.</p>

<p>At this period the young have not all been dropped, and the
most prized pelts are those of the unborn young, which are obtained
by killing the mother. These pelts, being very soft and fine in
texture, are used to make the most valuable <i>capas</i> or robes, and if
sold out of the tribes at the settlements, bring in the highest prices.</p>

<p>At this season the Indians move to their favourite hunting-grounds;
it is, in fact, to them the most important period of the year.
Two requisites are necessary to make their hunting a success: the
first is plenty of game, and in this there is rarely any disappointment;
the second is good ground on which to hunt it. As long,
however, as the guanaco do not take absolutely to the crags, the
Indians, with the help of their sure-footed unshod horses, are able
to levy a heavy toll on the herds.</p>

<p>The method of hunting adopted by the Tehuelches is interesting
enough to call for description at length. On the morning of
the hunt, the Indians saddle up a good long-journey horse apiece,
they also catch each man his fastest mount, upon which he puts a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
<i>bozal</i> and <i>cabresto</i>, as well as a bit in his mouth. The hunter
rides the former horse, and leads the latter for use later on.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_143" id="i_143"></a>

FOR OSTRICH<span class="i3">FOR GUANACO</span>      <span class="i3">FOR HORSES</span><br />
<span class="s08">(<i>In the Collection of the Author</i>)</span></p>
</div>

<p>The big herds of guanaco have meantime been located, and the
plan of the day's hunt arranged by the <i>cacique</i>. All the hunters
start forth in couples, riding in different directions, and so form an
immense circle, into the centre of which they systematically drive
the game. They then signal their whereabouts to one another
by means of smokes until the ring round the guanaco is complete.
Each hunter is accompanied by his dogs, of which he possesses
probably a score. Six or eight gaunt hounds of no particular
breed, but whose characteristic points run chiefly to legs and teeth,
follow their master. As the circle narrows the terrified game
huddle together in the centre of it, and there may be seen hundreds
of guanaco, many ostriches, and possibly a puma or two. The
guanaco bucks pace upon the edge of the herd, and give out their
neighing, half-defiant call as their human enemies approach.</p>

<p>The positions assumed by guanaco when under the influence
of curiosity and fear are most singular. They will stand staring
at the Indians for many seconds, and will then dash off at a wild
gallop with the strange leaping run peculiar to them. The necks,
too, swing and sway at all conceivable angles, and whenever their
ears are assailed by a sudden sound, I have seen a whole herd, upwards
of one hundred strong, sway their necks to within a couple
of inches of the ground almost in unison.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the Indians draw remorselessly nearer, dismount
from their saddle-horses, leap on their led animals, and precipitate
themselves from all sides upon the frantic herds. The horses
that are left have generally been carefully schooled to stand when
their reins are dropped forward to the ground over their heads. The
Indians howl and roar as they dash down upon the guanaco,
whirling their <i>boleadores</i> round their heads. This <i>bolas</i>, with which
they hunt the guanaco, is very heavy, and the three balls are
generally made of stone, but they use a lighter form for the
capture of the ostrich. In the case of guanaco <i>chicos</i>, clubs are
often employed.</p>

<p>Holding his weapon by the shortest of the three <i>sogas</i>, or
thongs, and while going at full gallop, the Indian launches it at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
long neck of the guanaco; a doe is always selected if possible.
Extremely expert in its use, the rider's weapon probably reaches
its mark, and the quarry, maddened by the tightening of the <i>sogas</i>,
bucks and rears, until she becomes hopelessly entangled.</p>

<p>I have mentioned that the Tehuelches hunt in pairs. The
companion of the Indian who has thrown the <i>bolas</i> then leaps to the
ground and despatches the guanaco. Meantime his comrade has
dashed forward at the tail of the herd, and has probably secured
another animal. The dogs, too, do their part, and as the storm of
the chase sweeps across the pampa, it leaves the ground in its path
dotted with the yellow-brown forms of the slain.</p>

<p>The chase tails itself out for many miles, and may be followed
over desolate leagues marked by lines of dead guanacos and dropped
<i>boleadores</i> which have failed to carry home. I should be afraid to
say how many animals are killed at one of these singular battues.
To see the Indian hunt the guanaco is to see the art of rough-riding
exemplified. How they gallop! Down one sheer <i>barranca</i>,
or cliff, and up another. The roar of loosened stone behind them.
The guanaco jink and dodge and break back, always making for
the highest ground in the vicinity.</p>

<p>The dexterity with which the horses of the hunters keep their
feet is truly wonderful. They will go at full gallop anywhere, and
hardly ever fall or miss their footing. There is, however, one
thing which they universally dislike, and that is jumping in any of
its forms. Here and there in some parts of Patagonia the pampa
is cut and scored with fissures a few feet in width. To have your
horse stop dead, both feet together, on the edge of one of these
and violently shy away at an acute angle is no uncommon experience.
Generally, however, a certain amount of inducement
and coercion at length takes them over in a complicated buck.</p>

<p>When the chase has run itself out, the lean dogs are fed upon
the grosser parts, the pelts of the young are pulled off, and the
meat, such of it as is wanted, is cargoed or packed upon the horses,
and the hunting-party jogs back to the shelter of the wigwams,
made from the skins their fathers and their grandfathers slew before
the white men began to move southward and to overrun the land.</p>

<p>The Indians kill no bird save the ostrich, and this is a curious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
fact, because the lagoons and pools literally swarm with great
flocks of upland geese (<i>Chloephaga magellanica</i>), which are very
fair eating. Perhaps the reason why they spare the geese arises
from the fact that they have no weapons suitable for killing them.
On one occasion when I shot a brace of geese, the Indians seized
upon them and pronounced them "good." Also, they kill few
animals but the guanaco and the puma. Had the guanaco a
reasonable amount of fat upon it, the life of the Indians would be
idyllic, but in this the guanaco fails. Of lean meat he supplies
plenty, for he is a large beast, but though he lives in a land where
sheep grow fat and well-liking, the long-necked Patagonian llama
retains his leanness and his running condition.</p>

<p>Although it may be slightly outside the province of this book,
I cannot help contrasting the very different methods employed by
the Onas of Tierra del Fuego, who are after all only separated
from the Tehuelches of Patagonia by the narrow Straits of
Magellan, in hunting the same animal. The Onas do not use
horses, and kill the guanaco with bows and arrows. When they
perceive a herd, they surround it as the Tehuelches do, but, of
course, the circle is on a much smaller scale. It is their aim to
remain invisible to their quarry, for which purpose, during their
stalk, they are in the habit of wrapping themselves in the skins of
the animals which they have formerly killed. Once the herd is
surrounded, it is with the same accompaniment of screams and
shouts that the hunters rush in to secure their prey.</p>

<p>The dissimilarities between the Tehuelches and the Onas are
numerous.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> While the Tehuelches are peaceful, the Onas are
warlike. There is a story current that the only white man who
has ever lived in the very primitive dwelling of boughs, which
are all the Onas have to shelter them from a bitter climate, was a
Scotchman whom the Indians had captured. He was with them
three weeks, and his face was adorned by a singularly luxuriant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
crop of orange whiskers. The Onas are reported to have amused
themselves by pulling these out in instalments by the roots.
Might not some anthropologist base a treatise upon "The
Artistic Perceptions of the Onas of Tierra del Fuego" upon
this occurrence?</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_148" id="i_148"></a>
<img src="images/i_148.jpg" width="550" height="396" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BEAUTIES OF TIERRA DEL FUEGO</p>
</div>

<p>The Onas are also a tall people, although not equalling in
height my friends the Tehuelches, and their physical development
is less conspicuously remarkable. The Ona woman does not, as
does the Tehuelche <i>china</i>, form an attachment to a white suitor,
appearing to have no desires outside her own race and people,
but under certain circumstances the women have shared the hearthstone
of the foreigner. Polygamy is allowed and practised among
them. There is something of the spirit which characterises the
Gipsy of Europe about this people; they are quite ready to take
all they can get from the alien, while they at the same time maintain
a bitter rancour against the hand that gives. But this is not,
as it is in the case of the Gipsies, the continuance of an original
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
dislike and implacability, but rather the result of the infamous ill-faith
which leavened the dealings of the very earliest visitors to
the coasts of Tierra del Fuego.</p>

<p>I must confess that all my sympathies are on the side of the
primitive races, who on coming into contact with the white man
suffer those outrages on their best feelings which, I am sorry to
say, are only too common. You must understand, however, that I
in no way refer to the settlers of this generation. My remarks
must be taken to refer to the first pioneers. At the present day&mdash;so
Burbury, who has had a great experience of Tierra del
Fuego, informed me&mdash;the Indians there are treacherous and
absolutely implacable, and do endless harm in their periodical
raids upon the "white guanaco," as they call the sheep. They
do this not only when hunger presses them, but at all times out of
a spirit of revenge. Sometimes they drown the sheep and leave
them in the ice, where they keep good for weeks, during which
time the Onas feast on them.</p>

<p>Patagonia bears upon its length the clear-cut and long-drawn
initial of the Tehuelche race. By this I mean the Indian trail,
which can be followed from water to water, from good camp to
good camp, stretching from Punta Arenas in the south to Lake
Buenos Aires in the north and beyond it. Up and down this trail
and along others, less extended, generations of Indians have
wandered with their wives and children, their tents and horses.
We struck it when travelling south from Lake Buenos Aires, in
the early January of 1901. It was hard to distinguish the
Indian road from any parallel series of guanaco-tracks, which
here line the country in numbers, and, indeed, it was only by
keeping a sharp look-out for the hoof-prints of horses that we were
able to follow the trail at all. It runs along under the Cordillera at
a varying distance of about twenty or thirty miles from their bases.
It was a sad remark that an Indian made to us while talking about
the ancient wanderings of his people. "Once," he said, "we had the
sea upon the one side of us, and upon the other the Cordillera.
But this is not so now. The white man is ever advancing upon one
side and the Cordillera remains ever unchanging upon the other.
Soon there will be no place for us; yet once the land was ours."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>One would imagine that a people so dependent on their horses
for the very necessities of life would give attention and care to the
breeding and improvement of the stock. But this is far from
being the case. The Tehuelches appear to be, like other far less
intelligent races of uncivilised peoples, incapable of much forethought.
They live for to-day and make little provision for
to-morrow. As a case in point, they are allowing their horses
to become very deteriorated. The animals are, almost without
exception, to use a Spanish term, <i>mañero</i>, which means of a
spoiled temper. In some localities they have been crossed with
the horses of the settlers which have a strain of English blood,
and the result is animals of spirit and of character, but <i>muy
mañero</i>. The Tehuelches prize white horses, and <i>overos</i>, or
piebalds, exceedingly. The backs of their horses are generally
badly galled, but this is no matter for surprise, as they often ride
upon a sheepskin flung anyhow across the beast. The method of
breaking-in or taming is simple and severe in the extreme. It
consists of leaping on a raw colt and galloping him to exhaustion.
One reason why their horses are falling below level certainly is
that the Indians have a foolish trick of riding two- and three-year-olds
both hard and far. A colt of this age once fairly "cooked"
by an over-long ride will never be of very much use afterwards.</p>

<p>And yet these people are peculiarly dependent upon their
horses. They will not walk ten yards if they can ride them.
And they have undoubtedly carried the art of riding to the last
perfection. I never knew what riding really meant until I went to
Patagonia and saw the Indians on horseback. We once asked an
Indian what he could do if he were left on the pampa without his
horses. "Sit down," he said. This man, however, was not a
Tehuelche but a Pampa Indian.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_151" id="i_151"></a>
<img src="images/i_151.jpg" width="378" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SONS OF THE PAMPA</p>
</div>

<p>The horses are far from large, the average running to about
thirteen hands, but they are wiry, untiring beasts, and some show
extraordinary speed. The manner in which they carry the heavy
well-developed Indians is wonderful. They are entirely fed on
grass. When the camp is made, they are simply turned out to
graze upon the pampa, where frequently the grass is sparse and
poor enough, though near many of the Indian camping-grounds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
good <i>vegas</i> of rich grass exist. In winter, of course, the <i>tropillas</i>
become very thin and in poor condition, but at that season they
have infinitely less work to do, as there is hardly any hunting, and
the camp is usually stationary for the coldest months.</p>

<p>The hounds of the Indians are something like our lurcher
breed. In the tents they lie about among the rugs and bedding.
They are irreclaimable thieves and very cowardly. A good
guanaco hound is, however, of very great value, for a pair of
accomplished hounds, skilled in the chase, represent a capital upon
which an entire family can live.</p>

<p>One of the strongest feelings which I brought away with me
from Patagonia was a hatred of the trader who battens upon the
failings of the Tehuelches. If he hears of a festival or any tribal
ceremony, he arrives upon the spot with drink. He sells liquor
in exchange for horses, and when his customers are well steeped
in the poison he brings, he makes some magnificent bargains.
His influence is far-reaching and fatal as far-reaching to the
picturesque and harmless race out of whose degradation and
death he makes his living. Savage races may survive war and
internecine struggles, and the decimation not infrequently caused
by a cruel rule such as was T'Chaka among the Zulus, but they
never survive the Civilisation of the Bottle. The horrors of the
wars of history would pale beside the cold-blooded slaughter, the
gradual, malignant, poisoning processes which the most self-satisfied
and religious nations of the world allow to continue year
after year, I should say century after century, among the aboriginal
tribes, who live nominally under their protection. The pioneer
trader with his stores of cheap maddening liquor is free to sell as
much as he pleases, although it is a well-known fact that such
trading means ruin and extermination to the unhappy ignorant
folk who buy. The sin after all is national rather than personal,
for the trader has his living to earn, whereas the nation which is
responsible for allowing him liberty to traffic puts out no hand to
stay the evil. I do not in the least bring any charge against the
Argentine Government; we British are guilty of the same crime
or carelessness, and in some of our dependencies terrible object-lessons
of precisely the same kind can be observed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p>Let me draw a picture of one of these traders for you. A
lean stooping man of Paraguayan extraction, dressed out in store
clothes which he but half filled. A plump face of the caste
peculiar to the lowest type of the Latin peoples, with a full greasy-lipped
animalism stamped upon it, after the manner of his kind.
The lean body and fat face formed a contrast that struck you
with repulsion as an actual deformity. This fellow played a very
old trick upon a batch of Indians and considerably enriched
himself thereby.</p>

<p>The Indians had come in upon the outskirts of a coast-town,
rich with the sale of a six-months harvest of ostrich feathers,
guanaco-skins and other such merchandise as they gather from the
pampas. After some drinking and a variety of games of chance,
our friend the trader started an argument as to which of the
Indians owned the swiftest horse. A race was soon decided upon,
the trader most liberally offering a prize in the shape of a bottle
of drink. The race was to be ridden bare-back, as is usual in
contests of this description among the Indians. The trader
further suggested that the race should be run off in heats. A
horse with a white blaze and a very fine head won, and his proprietor,
a tall Indian in a black poncho, received the prize, which
he, with help, soon disposed of. After this the talk fell naturally
upon the merits of the respective horses.</p>

<p>"Your <i>picaso</i> is a good horse," said the trader to the tall
Indian, "but I have a horse in my troop that could leave him far
behind."</p>

<p>At first the Indian laughed, but the trader's boasting and
insistence presently stung him to resent the aspersion on his
mount, and he said he should like to see the thing done.</p>

<p>The trader jumped at the opportunity. The Indians had had
sufficient drink to destroy their ordinary cautiousness, and were
ready to take up any challenge.</p>

<p>"The loser to forfeit his horse to the winner," continued the
trader, who had laid his plans beforehand. He then called a
Chileno lad, who soon appeared leading a big lean <i>alazan</i>. It
was easy for any seeing eye to recognise that the animal had been
tied up the night before and was in quite fair racing trim; besides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
which, the Indian's <i>picaso</i> was already tired with the previous races.
The Chileno boy swung up and the two horses came thundering
along their course. The Indian's weight also told as compared
with the lightness of the Chileno boy, and the result was altogether
a foregone conclusion.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_155" id="i_155"></a>
<img src="images/i_155.jpg" width="550" height="443" alt="" />
<p class="caption">TEHUELCHES VISIT GALLEGOS</p>
</div>

<p>But this by no means ended the business. The Indians were
excited and ripe for any amount of gambling, and being skilfully
handled by the trader they did not leave the settlement until he
had stripped them of all their possessions. The tall Indian, who
had come in with eighty dollars and five horses, returned to his
camp with a two-kilo bag of <i>yerba</i> and on a horse which he had
been forced to buy for the return journey from the trader at, of
course, the trader's own price.</p>

<p>There are many Indians who avoid the coast-towns, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
although these do not go to the trader, the trader, as I have
mentioned in another chapter, comes to them.</p>

<p>Throughout Patagonia, upon the rim of civilisation, are
scattered <i>boliches</i>, or frontier drink-shops, whose liquor sales
consist chiefly of "champagne cognac," whatever that potion
may be. These establishments hold out a perpetual temptation
to the passing Indians. The frequent presence of silver gear,
such as the Tehuelches possess when fortune smiles upon them,
that is almost always hanging from the ceiling of the neighbouring
store, tells its own tale. An Indian has rarely enough money to
"look upon the wine when it is red," or rather upon the unwholesome
jaundice tinge of "champagne cognac," so he pays in kind;
and when once the craving for drink grips him he will gamble
away everything to satisfy it. This infatuation appears to lay a
fatally strong hand upon the uncivilised peoples. They have no
principles to stay them, no scruples to overcome, they have found
a short cut to a wild species of happiness, and one cannot wonder
that they seek its extraordinary pleasures as often as possible. So
it is that liquor has destroyed whole races, wiped them clean off
the face of the earth. Some one has written:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Oppression and the sword slay fast,</p>
<p>Thy breath kills slowly but at last,</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>and it is certainly a terrible truth in this connection.</p>

<p>I can call to mind two Indians, whom I saw ride up to a <i>boliche</i>
near Santa Cruz. They offered a contrast to one another which
it is not easy to forget. The first was an Indian with a close-shut
mouth and the dark and ponderous dignity of the big Tehuelche.
His gear was richly studded with silver, and his saddle covered
with embroidered cloths. His head was bare, save that his brows
were bound with a band of red finery. He made a picturesque
and imposing figure as he cantered up on his white horse with its
glinting eyes. Followed the second. He, too, was an Indian, but
his gear was guiltless of silver, his <i>bozal</i> was worn and blackened
with age. The best thing he possessed was his horse. He wore
an ancient tail-coat, once black but now green, this in conjunction
with a <i>chiripa</i>, or Indian loin-cloth, gave him an appearance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
sufficiently incongruous. Instead of the quiet dignity of the first
man, his face expressed little save vacuity. He was a pitiful
object in the strong pampa sunshine, his health evidently broken
by frequent orgies. And no doubt he had been a self-respecting
Indian enough&mdash;before the trader came within the province of his
knowledge.

</p>

<p>We now set forth upon the last stage of our journey to Lake
Buenos Aires. I had hired one of the Indians to guide us across
the high pampa. He was, although dwelling in the tents of the
Tehuelches, not a Tehuelche. He called himself a <i>Patagonero</i>,
and belonged to one of the tribes of Pampa Indians of the north.
His tribe, he told me, were Christians. Before we left the Indian
encampment, one of the older ladies belonging to it began to
paint her face in horizontal lines of black, whether with a view to
capturing our hearts or not I cannot say.</p>

<p>We left on November 3, and accomplished a very long march
in the face of somewhat trying conditions. The Indian rode
ahead with his dogs on the look-out for ostriches. A mighty wind
from the west, cold with the snow of the Cordillera, blew in our
faces, bringing with it showers of sand that stung us sharply. We
could hardly persuade the horses to meet the wind, and their hoofs
kicked up still more sand for our benefit. We were off shortly
after nine o'clock, and about noon I would have given much to say
"Camp." When fighting with the elements one goes through
three distinct stages. First, there is the stage exultant, during
which you feel the joy of battle, and struggle rejoicingly. The
second comes when the irresistible tires you down, however
strong you are, and forces the sense of your puniness so plainly
upon you that you feel a sort of hurt despair, and a half impulse to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
give in before a force so far beyond you. Last of all, you go on
enduring until you become, as it were, acclimatised, and inclined to
laugh at the despair you experienced a while previously. So it
was on this day's march. About noon I said to myself as we were
crossing the high pampa above the <i>barranca</i> of the River Chalia&mdash;a
desolate spot, rough and tussocky, and gambolled over by Titanic
winds&mdash;"We will camp at four sharp." The decision at the
moment was a comfort, but in the end we did not camp until
close upon seven o'clock, blind with sand, and our hands bleeding
from the cold and the harsh friction of the cargo ropes.</p>

<p>It was as we approached this camp that I saw beside a lagoon
of snow-water two American oyster-catchers (<i>Hæmatopus palliatus</i>)
which, no doubt, had nested in the vicinity, as, on my going closer,
they rose and circled with their darting flight above my head, but
I failed to find the nest. There were many guanacos about, and I
was not surprised to hear that this lagoon, Laguna La Cancha, was
a very favourite encampment of the Indians. The scenery surrounding
the pool is peculiarly inhospitable. Some one remarked
that it reminded him of Doré's illustrations to the Inferno, adding,
"If you were to put heat to it, it would be Hell." Huge rolling
downs, bare hills, and no vegetation save a few tussocks and
scattered meagre shrubs. The Indian said the winter hits this
land very hard, and the whole district is buried under snow, only the
high, bald tops of the hills being visible.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday, but not on this occasion a day of
rest. One thought of the bells ringing far away at home and the
concourse of people moving along the winter roads. Here was
wind, cold, and a march, cargo to be fixed and refixed to the day's
end, then a windy camp-fire, and after a short sleep till dawn.
Hitherto the toil had been hard, but we were nearing the lake,
and looked forward to a time of rest and hunting.</p>

<p>We were rich in meat with the cow, sheep, a Darwin's rhea
caught by the Indian's dogs, and three geese. The hounds of the
Indian proved themselves to be troublesome thieves. Burbury
and I were obliged to sleep beside the meat. Besides being
cunning thieves the dogs were cowards. They were to all intents
and purposes wild as regarded their habits. Yet good guanaco-hounds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
represent very sterling value to their owners, whose livelihood
they procure. The best at the work I met with in Patagonia
were those which belonged to this Indian guide. We called the
man Como No because, whatever question was put to him, his
invariable reply took the form of "<i>Como no?</i>" or "Why not?"
You said perhaps, "It is not far to the next camping-ground, is it?"
"<i>Como no?</i>" he would answer. After some three hours at an
amble, you would repeat your inquiry. "Is it much farther?"
"<i>Como no?</i>" The most impossible queries met with precisely
the same response.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_162" id="i_162"></a>
<img src="images/i_162.jpg" width="550" height="538" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ON AHEAD</p>
</div>

<p>However indeterminate Como No may have been in his mental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
attitude, his dogs were definitely good ones. He owned a big
brindled dog, a small black one and a couple of yellow pups.
Como No had a habit of riding far ahead of the general troop of
men and horses, his figure making a far-off outline etched in black
against the cold blue horizon of the pampa. Sometimes, when he
lost sight of us for any length of time, he would burn a bush to give
us our direction by the smoke, and we would follow on, driving
the pack-horses and those free ones which were not being used
either for riding or cargo at the time. Presently, perhaps, when
rounding a low thicket, we would come suddenly upon him, squatted
on his haunches beside a dead ostrich, from which he had stripped
the feathers. These feathers, though far inferior to those of the
African ostrich, or of <i>Rhea americana</i>, are worth anything from
two to four dollars.</p>

<p>As he rode forward again, his dogs would range on either side
of him. By-and-by they would again start an ostrich or a
guanaco, and pull it down within 500 or 600 yards. Whereupon
Como No would ride up, drive them off, kill and cut up the
quarry, giving the hounds the liver, strip the feathers if it happened
to be an ostrich, and then mount and ride on once more. This
performance would be repeated over and over again during the
course of the march, until, before we saw the last of him, his
saddle had become an enormous bunch of feathers, from out of
which his body and shoulders protruded in a quaint manner.</p>

<p>At night these dogs, however, were a terrible nuisance. They
would forage about the camp for food, and pull down the meat we
had placed on bushes and devour it. Such was eventually the
fate of the last remnants of the mutton we had with us, and the
loss was all the harder as we knew that the stolen mutton was the
last we were destined to taste for months. After that we lived on
lean guanaco.</p>

<p>By this date we had gradually climbed to some 1200 feet
above the sea-level, and the temperature was extremely cold. Our
reindeer-beds became a great comfort.</p>

<p>The 5th began with an hour of welcome sun, but it passed
only too soon, and the wind rose more piercingly cold than ever.
It penetrated to one's very bones. We, however, made seven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
leagues, and reached the River Genguel, which here makes a
great curve. We camped in a narrow shute, strewn with big
stones and giving upon the river, the <i>cañadon</i> being very wide
and devoid of shelter. The water was broken into small sharp
waves by the wind, and we were glad to collect what firewood
was obtainable&mdash;bushes being scarce at that spot&mdash;and make a
fire. The Indian burned a bush and warmed himself. His
dogs had, unaided by him, killed a small guanaco and a fox
(<i>Canis griseus</i>). We lay by the fire and the wind came down
bitterly chill from the Sierra Nevada, while Jones cooked, and we
learnt the delights which, in a cold climate, are to be found in
mutton fat! After food to bed, and then a cold sleet set in. It
was a nasty night, but in our reindeer bags we were, of course,
untouched by the cold.</p>

<p>Next day nine leagues were achieved. Very long marches
these, but we were pressing on to reach Lake Buenos Aires.
<i>Cañadon</i> and pampa and high ground succeeded each other as we
rode along, sometimes bare, sometimes sandy, sometimes thorn-covered,
often stony and strewn with fragments of basalt.
Generally overhead a pallid blue sky, and below wind, wind,
perpetual wind. So we toiled on past little chill lagoons, ruffled
with the keen breeze, until in the afternoon I came up with
Burbury and the Indian on a rise, and there lay our goal before us&mdash;a
great stretch of water wonderfully blue and cold-looking
beneath the Sierra Nevada, whose summits were crowned with
snow above their dusky purple.</p>

<p>The Tostado kicked off his cargo during the day, and among
the scattered contents of Jones' kit I picked up a broken looking-glass.
I had not seen myself since leaving Colohuapi, and confess
I found no cause for vanity in the sight of a distinctly dirty-looking
pirate with smoke-reddened eyes, a peeling face and nose,
and with enough beard to put a finishing-touch to the horrid
spectacle.</p>

<p class="caption">ONAS STALKING GUANACO</p>
</div>

<p>On the 3rd I discovered a scorpion in my bed in spite of the
cold. By the 6th we reached the River Fenix, and, crossing to
an island, camped in the sleet, the temperature reading that night
being 30° F. From there we pushed on to the farther bank, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
marched to the camping-ground of the Indians, which, though the
nearest of their old camps to Lake Buenos Aires, was still a good
distance from it. The Azulejo had been lost, but was brought
in quite spent, by Barckhausen. Poor little beast! He lay down
more dead than alive under a bush, a pathetic little figure enough.
After reaching camp, Jones and I had to turn out again, pretty
tired as we were, to look for food. We rode for hours, and saw
only a herd of guanaco. At this season the country round about
here is rather devoid of game, the ground is stony, with thorn and
dry, blackened bushes. We were disappointed in our hunt again on
the second day, seeing only two guanaco, lion-tracks, and a couple
of pigeons, but we did not shoot them, and I am unable to speak
with any certainty of the species to which they belonged. I have
never seen a district so bare of life. We had come, as it were, to
the world's end.</p>

<p>I sat in my tent-door and wrote my diary. Far away I could
see the Cordillera, splendid giants, with the sun shining upon them;
below, the lake that reminded me strongly of the picture in which
Hiawatha sailed into "the kingdom of Ponemah, the Land of the
Hereafter." That scene was just so wild, and so remote, with a
great red sunset burning over it, and round about it rock and sand
and marsh, with a pale wide rim of dead-wood, swept down
by floods from the neighbouring forests.</p>

<p>On our way to the shores of the lake we had passed through
a stretch of extraordinary aridity, a white and yellow spread of
mud and stones that filled a valley between two scrub-covered
hills. From far off it looked level, but in reality we found it to
be intersected and veined with mighty gashes, which formed
winding gorges. There the wind blew, and at times the sun
beat down; very cold it was, and very hot by turns, but never
temperate.</p>

<p>We had expected to find plenty of game in the vicinity of the
lake, but in this, as I have said, we were disappointed, the
consequence being that our supply of meat ran short. There was
nothing for it but to kill the eighteen-months old colt of one of the
<i>madrinas</i>. But before we did this we hunted for three days, during
which time I shot a couple of upland geese, which made the sum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
total of our bag. In a new country one has always to buy
experience. We were buying ours at this period. Owing to the
wildness of our horses the journey from Trelew had been an
especially trying one, although, under other circumstances, the
difficulties need not be great.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The breakdown of the waggon at
so early a stage had entailed a large amount of extra labour, and
by the time we reached Lake Buenos Aires we were, both men and
horses, pretty well done up.</p>

<p>On the third day of our hunting I took Barckhausen instead of
Jones, who had been out with me on the two previous days. We
passed along through the stony thorn-lean gorges towards the east.
Here nothing lived save the strong birds of prey, and lions, whose
tracks we observed leading to the rocks. Death lay nakedly there
in all directions, skull and backbone, with rain-polish and snow-polish
upon them, picked clean years ago by now-dead caranchos
and chimangos.</p>

<p>During our ride we saw two monster owls, two condors, many
caranchos, and so pushed on over hill rising behind hill, stony,
dark, with wind-lifted wisps of sand turning and twisting upon
them.</p>

<p>In the early afternoon we came upon a more pleasant land, and
to a little marshy pool in a hollow of the hills, crowded round with
forest-bushes, and upon this pool from far away I spied two upland
geese. I dismounted, took my gun, and began a stalk. While I
was still well out of range a bough broke under my foot, and the
geese were away. We lay up for a time, but the birds did not
return, so we took a turn westwards in the hope of getting some
coots I had observed the day before upon another lagoon, close to
Lake Buenos Aires. Upon the shore of the lake a smart shower
of sleet, hail, and rain overtook us, and we had to lie down in the
lee of a thorn-bush. I saw one golden guanaco racing along a
hill-top against the sunset. Some coots were on the lake; I
shot four, but contrary winds drove them out into the water too
deep to venture after them, and we turned campwards empty-handed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>

<p>As we galloped over the hills the clouds broke on the western
side of the lake, and made a scene ominously beautiful. The
rifted dusky blue, the long pale gleam of water shining like an
angel's sword, the white snow-peaks, the purple-black belly of
the rain-storm, all cast together formed a picture that affected the
senses strongly.</p>

<p class="caption">HORSHAM BASE CAMP</p>
</div>

<p>As we neared camp, I saw something gleam white behind a
bush. An upland goose! I crawled up and found two. With
what care I managed that stalk! I killed the female with one
barrel on the ground and pulled over the male as he swung
upwards. After riding seven leagues, we got our small results of
the day's seeking within a mile of the camp! One or other of
us had seen far-off guanaco flying out of sight, and I decided
to start next day for the River Fenix to try for some, camping
there the night and returning next day to begin our long-needed
rest.</p>

<p>Yet the next day (November 9) none of us went a-hunting
after all. We were fairly played out. Personally I had had not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
one day's rest since starting two months before, as upon me principally
fell the duty of providing for the pot, so that upon coming
in of an evening on the close of a long march it was usually
necessary to saddle a fresh horse and ride a further distance from
five to fifteen miles in search of game.</p>

<p>So we killed the colt to provide for our wants while men and
horses enjoyed well-earned repose. I had formed a base-camp
about five miles from the shores of the lake, intending to make
short expeditions, lightly equipped, round and about the vicinity.
As for the camp, three large thorn-bushes were Nature's contribution
towards it, and what a relief even the shelter of a thorn-bush
can be in the Kingdom of the Winds, you could only learn by
an experience such as was ours. Below the camp, which stood on
a ridge, the ground fell away in a three-mile slope to the usually
angry water; eastwards was a <i>pantano</i> or swamp of yellow reeds,
which ran a long way below the scrub-grown ridge. The tents
huddled back-to-wind, as much under the lee of the bushes as
possible. We made an oven, but it turned out a failure, the earth
being too soft for our purpose. Round the fire was a hedge of
thorn hung with horse-blankets, red, yellow and black, which gave
a rather festive air to the camp. The only sounds were the
neigh of a horse, the hooting of night-birds, and the never-silent
wind.</p>

<p>During the night of the 10th, half a gale of wind blew up with
an extraordinary rancour of coldness. I lay in my tent and heard
the sides of it flapping like some great wounded bird. Sleep was
put off till far into the small hours. Through the open tent-door I
could look at the bushes writhing in the gale, the long black back
of the ridge and the glint of stars. How often one sees in half-sleep
the scenes of home and of the past! I seemed again to be
watching the boats coming in and the tides rising with the well-known
ripple and pouring rush of water on a shallow beach, tides
that in boyish days held so infinite a romance. Where did the
storms that broke there come from? whither went the dark hulls
after they sank below the blue edge of sea? Or where did the
fishermen sail their boats to&mdash;lonely rocks from which they brought
back parrot-beaked, jelly-armed <i>pieuvres</i>? And yet, having drifted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
into some long wanderings, and now into that wilderness, no scene
that I have ever looked upon, however wild or lonely, has touched
me in any way that could compare with the thrill of those early
dreams. Romance lies always a little too far away; only in childhood
is the gate of that wonderful garden open to us, and we gaze
and long for the fruit we are never to handle.</p>

<p>Our tents at Horsham Camp&mdash;so we named it&mdash;were the only
green things in the landscape. They happened to be of a pale
green. Riding out from the camp in most directions you found
yourself amongst a bare and wind-swept series of ridges two
or three hundred feet in height, which appeared to roll away
across the wide continent. Sunday was welcome. It was noticeable
how Sunday abroad always affected men, some of whom at
home spared small attention for the day. Life went evenly. The
others took it in turn to cook. I generally rode out early. The
troop were rounded up and our first meal came about 7 o'clock.
After that I used to go to my tent and write while the men busied
themselves with any job on hand. Cocoa at two on Sundays, and
about six a meal of meat and beans. And so to bed. The day
before the colt was killed, Tom, my hound, stole a dumpling from
the plate of one of the party as he sat eating. The loser at once
pursued the thief, retrieved the dumpling and ate it, so you will
understand that there was no wastefulness among us!</p>

<p>By November 12 I was tired of inaction, tired of the tent,
tired of the camp. The wind continued. Surely in all his
writings R. L. Stevenson never made a more perfect phrase than
the "incommunicable thrill of things." A wood-scent in the
morning, the sound of the wind at night, the clear cinders of the
fire or a whiff of burning wood&mdash;one receives the spark that fires
the train of thought and leads us far away. No indolence of the
soul this, but the fulfilling of some beautiful law at the junction
of the spiritual and the natural, infused through a thousand
tissues and welded by a thousand heredities.... One writes
much of this kind of thing, for, afar from all books or chance
of interchanging ideas, one falls back upon oneself, and one's pen
is a safe outlet for superfluous imaginings.</p>

<p>On that afternoon I caught a horse and went down to the long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
point that stretches out into the lake. Although this was a ride
of upwards of twenty miles, I saw no living thing upon the land,
and on the water only a couple of grebes and three upland geese.
My way lay through dense thickets of low growth, the going
very sandy and treacherous. The high-water mark, or, as I should
rather say, the flood-mark of the lake was outlined by piles and
piles of driftwood of milk-toothlike whiteness. Some of the trunks
were as large in girth as my body. All this comes down from
the mountain forests, carried by torrents from the melting snows.
The vegetation on that side of the lake was the most florid and
sizeable that I had so far seen in Patagonia. High flowering
grass, thorn-bush thickets almost impenetrable, and between these
and the margin of the water a wide strewing of rotten trunks of
antarctic beech and poles of an arborescent grass-like bamboo.
On my way back I made a short cut through the edge of the lake,
of which the bed was shingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>

<p><i>November 13.</i>&mdash;I went to the River Fenix and shot a guanaco.
Afterwards I took a six-mile walk and shot two snipe. Lake
Buenos Aires was certainly the very heart of the wind's domain.
While we were there the wind never died down, it blew all the
time, often lifting sand and gravel, and sometimes a great piece
of our camp-fire, sheltered as that was. It raged on most days,
blowing so hard that some people in England would not have
cared to venture out of doors.</p>

<p>I have so far given no description of our tents, which were probably
the nearest approach to comfort within many hundred miles
of Horsham Camp. Mine was small, seven feet by a short six,
and four feet high, sustained by four ropes and a pole, the place
of the second pole&mdash;which we lost&mdash;being taken by a bow-legged
slip of califate-wood. The tent contained two beds made up of
skins and ponchos laid on the green canvas floor, a soldered tin of
plug tobacco served by way of a candlestick and upheld a candle-end.
Round and about the tent and on its excrescent flooring
were heaped our boxes, otherwise the wind would have blown it
over. It was a mere bag of a place, with an exit like an animal's
hole; but at night, when the storm howled without, our dim light
looked homely, the tobacco-scented air was grateful, and a bit of
camphor lent its aroma to the place. And there one could lie at ease
and read or think at pleasure.</p>

<p>On the 14th I shot another guanaco; it was curious that we
were always rich in meat or else in absolute want of it. I had gone
out on Jones' black horse for a little exercise towards the River
Deseado, and there I surprised the guanaco. He was an old buck
and solitary. He gave me a nice shot, then walked a step or two
and fell dead. At Horsham Camp we lived in some dread of
scorpions; Jones found one on his saddle, Burbury another in the
flour or the cooking-pot, and some roosted in our bedding. By the
way, our kitchen arrangements were becoming very scanty at that
period; we had but two cooking-pots left and one kettle, thanks to
the energetic treatment they had received at the heels of the
<i>cargueros</i>. It was fervently hoped by all the party that nothing
would go wrong with any of these, or we should have been most
uncomfortably situated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p>On the 15th I started with Burbury and Scrivenor to make an
expedition towards Mount Pyramide. Upon our way we were
astonished to see three herds of guanaco&mdash;fourteen, and ten, and
then twenty-one&mdash;at different times. Although I was well within
shot I did not try to kill any, as we had meat enough.</p>

<img src="images/i_176.jpg" width="477" height="483" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SEÑOR HANS P. WAAG, OF THE ARGENTINE BOUNDARY COMMISSION</p>
</div>

<p>On this day the first huemul seen on our expedition was
observed by Burbury. First he saw a buck, afterwards two does,
but, owing to the nature of the ground, he was unable to get a shot.
We were naturally very anxious to secure a specimen of this very
interesting and little known deer, but it was not until we made our
trip round the south side of the lake that we were successful.</p>

<p>We made our way across an abomination of desolation, a grey
old desert; then crossing a marsh, we descended by a white cliff
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
to the margin of a deep brown lagoon. Of many colours were these
lagoons. Burbury said that region was more dismal than Tierra
del Fuego&mdash;old deserts, varied by marshes and califate-bush, stone
and boulder, thorn and sand. After a rest in the afternoon we
rode on, and presently struck a deserted camp of the Argentine
Boundary Commission, near which the steam-launch, which had
been brought across the pampas for the exploration of Lake
Buenos Aires, was secreted.</p>

<p>Nothing in the world looks more forlorn than a deserted camp.
But we were far from being depressed on this occasion, for in this
old camp of Mr. Hans Waag's we made a find which we looked
upon as a great slice of luck.</p>

<p>On November 2nd I find in my diary: "More accidents to
the cooking-pots, this time at the hoofs of Horqueta. The flat-bottomed
pot still survives, but the round one and the kettle
are more damaged than whole. One more such accident will mean
that the corned-beef tins must be called into requisition."</p>

<p>In this camp we found sundry boxes, old iron-bound packing-cases,
and while I was engaged in lighting the fire I heard an
exclamation behind me, and Burbury sang out:</p>

<p>"Here's a big enamelled saucepan, nearly new!" It was so,
and then again, "And here's another. What luck!"</p>

<p>Of course, if those saucepans had not been shut up in cases, they
might have been considered treasure-trove. As it was, one did not
need the deductive powers of a Sherlock Holmes to conclude that
the travellers who had hidden these pots away so carefully meant
to return, find, and once again use them. They belonged, as I
knew, to Mr. Waag's Commission of Limits, as they call the
Boundary Commission out there. When I met that gentleman in
Buenos Aires I never dreamt that I should yet be reduced to stealing
his cooking utensils. But we did not "steal" them, we only
"availed" ourselves of them. I hope my readers see the difference
as plainly as we saw it. And what do you think our companions
said when they heard the story? Did they urge us to make restitution?
What they said referred to the finding of some empty
bottles among the rubbish, "A pity there was no whisky in them!"
If there had been, of course we should not ... well, who knows?

</p>

<p>At last we had arrived at Lake Buenos Aires, a time long looked
forward to. The pampas were crossed and left behind, and the
lower line of the Andes was reached, the foothills of the great
range whose upper summits we had watched for weeks lying high
on the sky-line, blue and white and cold, sending the message of a
great wind from them to us. We were now upon the shores of
the largest of the wonderful network of lakes and lagoons which
stretches parallel with the Cordillera hundreds of miles to the
southward, ending not far from the Straits of Magellan.</p>

<p>There was to me something infinitely romantic about Lake
Buenos Aires. Its aspect was ever changing, and so often you
came on a scene supremely beautiful. The wild light of sunset
upon the snow-peaks, the grey turbulent water of the lake, and the
bull-like wind charging down at us day after day&mdash;all these things
gave the place an individuality of its own.</p>

<p>The lake is of considerable extent, measuring seventy-five miles
in length from S.S.W. to N.N.E., and its waters wage a continual
war upon the thorns and scrub growing upon the margin. Vast
masses of milk-white timber, blanched by the influences of sun and
water and eloquent of the mountain-land of forest whence they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
have been washed down, lie at the lip of the flood level. When I
was there in the dry season the upper rim of timber was about 200
yards distant from the edge of the water.</p>

<p class="caption">INLET OF LAKE BUENOS AIRES</p>
</div>

<p>The sharp contrast of fertility and sterility that one meets with
in Patagonia is remarkable, the more so as they often lie in close
proximity the one to the other. I have mentioned an arid spread
of yellow mud and stones cut up by deep gorges which we crossed
before reaching the lake. I do not think that any painter desiring
to picture desolation could do better than descend the central gorge
and there paint its gaunt and rugged outlines, tumbled together in
a horror of barrenness that the eyes ached to look upon. Yet close
to this place, within ten yards of it, a neck of land displayed green
scrub, ay, and flowers&mdash;beautiful purple sweet-pea-like flowers
in profusion! And on the farther side was a green gully with
two blue peaty waterholes.</p>

<p>Near by, as I have said, we established a base camp, from
which we made four expeditions towards the Cordillera, which lie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
on the westward of the lake, while, singularly enough, the continental
divide appears to be to the eastward of it. On our trips we
took with us merely a horse apiece, and carried provisions on our
saddles. Meantime the remainder of the troop, which had suffered
somewhat on our journey from Bahia Camerones, were turned out
to rest and luxuriate upon the marsh grass, that extended in a
broad strip for a couple of miles under the ridge, while downhill
from the camp towards the south this rich <i>pantano</i> spread still
farther.</p>

<p>Around the lake lay piled the skulls and bones of dead game,
guanaco and a few huemules. These animals come down to live
on the lower ground and near unfrozen water during the cold
season, and there, when the weather is particularly severe, they die
in crowds. We saw their skeletons, in one or two places literally
heaped one upon the other.</p>

<p>During our stay in this neighbourhood I took the opportunity
of examining most thoroughly the shores of the lake. The ground
which descended to them was cut and intersected by <i>pantanos</i> of
wet or drying mud and sand. Upon the eastern shore rose dunes,
covered with dense low strips of scrub. In the <i>pantanos</i> the
tracks made in the end of the winter, when the snow has melted
and the ground is soft, remain visible for five or six months.
And thus these hardened marshes offer a study of considerable
interest.</p>

<p>Although the Indians declared that guanaco rarely visited the
lake, this proved to be incorrect. In the winter a considerable
number must live upon and about the shores, for their unmistakable
tracks were always to be found. Towards Mount Pyramide on
the western side, the number of these tracks was distinctly less&mdash;rheas,
pumas, the animal known locally as the red fox or
Cordillera wolf (<i>Canis magellanicus</i>).</p>

<p>A few huemules (<i>Xenelaphus bisulcus</i>) exist upon the northern
shore. In the winter upland geese seem also to favour this spot
in large numbers. So strongly does the mud retain the impression
of tracks that I was able to follow the trail of a horse, which
must have been ridden by one of Mr. Waag's party six months
before, for a distance of a couple of miles.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span></p>

	<span class="s08"><i>Photochromogravure, Lyons &amp; London</i></span></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The Tehuelches probably copied this method from the Araucanians. As a rule the Indian stands or kneels
on his sheepskin saddle. Here is depicted the extreme position which would be assumed to show off. I have seen gauchos
do a similar trick, though few Patagonian horses will permit such liberties.</p>
</div>
<p>In summer the north shore of Lake Buenos Aires is one of
the poorest game centres in Patagonia. During the first fortnight
of our stay there we shot but two guanacos. Sometimes for a
week one would see nothing save an old ostrich, which was often
observed at the far end of the marsh where the horses fed, but
he was a wary bird with an experience of human methods, and he
would never allow us to approach within shot.</p>

<p>It seemed probable, from the evidence of the tracks, that at the
beginning of the hard weather the guanaco trekked down to the
level of the lake. For one track made in November there were
twenty made in July. The foregoing remarks only refer to the
northern shore of the lake; on the eastern and southern sides
things were very different, and about them we enjoyed good
sport.</p>

<p>On November 21, Scrivenor, Jones and I made a little
expedition to the River Fenix where it enters the lake, and there
we came upon the most favourable camping-ground we had yet
seen in the whole country. We pitched our camp&mdash;afterwards
called Rosy Camp&mdash;in the midst of high yellow grass beside the
narrow river that wound between banks, on which green low
scrub ran riot, and enormous califate-bushes made impenetrable
patches of thicket. Jones and I, on our arrival, went to examine
the mouth of the river. Our camp was quite drowsy with the
humming of insects, for, sheltered as it was from the wind by trees
and by the cliffs of a lonely hummock, it gave us a delightful feeling
of comfort and well-being after our many very different experiences
of camps among the high dunes and rocks over which the wind
whistled.</p>

<p>On the way Jones shot a Chiloe widgeon and I an upland
goose. We found many tracks of puma and some of guanaco and
huemul. As we walked towards the lake, I saw upon the outermost
promontory of land a guanaco outlined against the evening
sky. Hurrying on as fast as we could, which was not very fast,
as I had poisoned my knee and was lame, we found the herd on a
neck of land, to escape from which they would be obliged to pass
within a hundred yards of us provided they did not take to the
water. So we decided not to stalk them, but simply showed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
ourselves; as we expected, they broke landwards, passing within
about seventy yards with their ears laid back, swaying their long
necks and leaping and jinking among the stones. I pulled one
over as she ranged up the side of the cliff. She turned out to be
heavy with young, and the buck with her stopped at the top of
the hill, but when I went towards him he fled. We were delighted
at thus getting meat, especially as this guanaco was the fattest we
had yet shot. Her flesh was, however, very strong.</p>

<p>When we were returning Jones, who was in front, suddenly
said, "There go the horses!" It was so. They had stampeded,
leaving us to get home as best we could. We threw off our coats,
laid down our rifles carefully, and ran. Jones' horse was in hobbles,
but being used to them kept up with his companions; we were,
however, lucky enough to catch them after a couple of miles, and
making bridles out of our waist-scarves rode them into camp.
Scrivenor said the horses had suddenly started madly, broken
their <i>cabrestos</i>, dashed together and then made off. We thought
at the time they must have winded a puma, but this proved to be
a mistake, for in the night two of them again escaped, and Jones
retrieved them when the first streaks of dawn were etching the
landscape in black and white. He woke me and we discovered
that a wolf must have come into camp and stolen our duck and
goose. This wolf had also eaten both my rifle-slings within three
yards of where we were sleeping. While we were discussing
our ill luck and lamenting the fact that we had carefully plucked
the duck and goose upon the preceding evening, I observed
the author of our misfortunes calmly watching us from under a
bush. Revenge was, of course, uppermost in my thoughts. I killed
her with a Mauser. She proved to be an old female 3 ft. 8 in.
from the top of her teeth to the end of her tail.</p>

<p>It was beautifully warm all day in Rosy Camp, as we had
named it, and we lay on the ground after making much-needed
toilettes in the river.</p>

<p>The next night we had a visit from the mate of the wolf
we had killed. It is a singular fact that the horses were at the
least as much afraid of these wolves as they were of the pumas.
While I was writing my diary and nursing my knee, which had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
swollen to a great size, the wolf crept within ten yards and had a
look at me. I got up and limped across for my gun, but my
movements did not in the least seem to discompose his serenity.
He even advanced nearer, and showed not the smallest fear of me.
This quality of fearlessness is very marked in the Cordillera wolves,
which possess it in a
greater degree than the
pampa foxes. On one
occasion when a wolf
thus came to investigate
our camp, my
large deerhound, Tom,
ran at him, and was
met with a devastating
bite. Indeed, I had to
go to Tom's help. In
the present instance I
took up the shot-gun
and gave the brute a charge of No. 4. He leaped straight upwards
into the air, howling and snarling, and sank down quite dead.</p>

<p>These wolves kill young guanaco, and I have observed them
pursuing a huemul. They kill sheep when a flock is brought into
the neighbourhood of the Cordillera, generally remaining by their
quarry after daylight. I have never observed them farther
from the Cordillera than the northern shores of Lake Buenos
Aires.</p>

<p>On November 24, Scrivenor went back to the base camp, as
he had toothache. Jones and I rode south across the Fenix.
Although we saw the track of a huemul in the sand we failed to
catch any glimpse of the animals themselves on that day, but shot
four bandurias, locally called by the Welshmen "land-ducks." This
is the black-faced ibis (<i>Theristicus caudatus</i>). I was very eager
to secure a specimen of the huemul in his summer coat, and to
observe as much as possible of this beautiful deer, but no luck
attended us then in that particular. Finally, we went back to
Horsham Camp still unsuccessful. During our absence Burbury
had killed a large Cordillera wolf near Horsham Camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p>On November 28, Barckhausen and I camped in the <i>cañadon</i>
or valley of River Deseado, a swampy, reedy spot, tenanted by
great numbers of upland geese, flocks of Chiloe widgeon (<i>Mareca
sibilatrix</i>) and brown pintails. I also observed here the rosy-billed
duck (<i>Metopiana peposaca</i>), the blue-winged teal (<i>Querquedula
cyanoptera</i>), and what I took to be the red shoveller (<i>Spatula
platalea</i>). But this last-named bird I did not shoot, and so I
cannot speak with absolute certainty upon the point. Besides
these, I saw flamingoes (<i>Ph&oelig;nicopterus ignipalliatus</i>) and the
black-necked swan (<i>Cygnis nigricollis</i>). A flock of parrots were
flying about the heights, but of these I was unable to procure a
specimen. The reedy pools and backwaters in this <i>cañadon</i> were,
without exception, the most glorious paradise of wildfowl that I
have ever seen.</p>

<p>On our way back from the River Deseado I secured the first
<i>Rhea darwini</i> shot during the expedition. With the exception of
wild cattle, the ostrich is the most difficult to procure of Patagonian
game. These birds are always on the alert, and generally
make off when you are still a mile away. They never pause save
upon commanding ground. The most usual method of obtaining
them is to run them down with dogs or to <i>bolas</i> them after the
manner of the Indians and Gauchos on horseback. They are
indeed a quarry well worthy of the attention of the still-hunter.
The male is sometimes killed with a rifle when attending to the
chickens, towards whom&mdash;with the exception of laying the eggs&mdash;he
stands in place of a mother. At such times he will, when
approached, pretend to be wounded and limp away with wings
outspread to attract the hunters after him. An ostrich when shot
through the body will always run from thirty to forty yards before
dropping. This first ostrich, which I shot, was about four hundred
yards away, and I should not have secured him had he not allowed
me to get my range with a couple of preliminary shots. Down he
went at last, and, immediately afterwards, as I was congratulating
myself, appeared an ostrich running low through the grass. I
thought it was the one I had shot and struck back for my horse.
While I was galloping after the fast-disappearing bird, I rode
right on to the first bird, which had been shot through the lungs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
On measurement I found him to be five feet in height and three
feet high at the shoulder.</p>

<p>The greatest number of adult ostriches I ever saw together was
seven. This in a <i>cañadon</i> off the River Deseado. At a later
date I saw forty-two together, but this included many small and
immature birds.</p>

<p>The long-necked game of Patagonia is difficult to stalk owing
to their having such a field of vision. The ruse of tying up one's
horse in full view gained me many a guanaco, but was quite a
useless trick in the case of ostriches. The Cruzado was by this time
an A1 shooting-horse. He would stand anywhere and wait my
return, he would also allow me to fire quite close to him, but he
would never allow any white object to be put upon his back. If
this was done, he would at once rear and throw himself back.</p>

<p>There is one thing which strikes me forcibly with regard to
Patagonia. Here is small vestige of the elder peoples, and little
of any older civilisations.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Even in the hearts of deserts in the
old world are to be found traces of ancient cities, where men lived
long ages ago. But nothing that bears farthest resemblance to a
ruin, to the "one stone laid upon another" that tells of man's
settled home, exists in Patagonia. Yet though the ruined cities of
other countries are old, Patagonia is older yet. The nomad tribes
have roamed here through the centuries, leaving the grass to grow-over
their old camp-fires, but never altering or marking with any
permanent mark the face of this old land. No, though Patagonia
is in a sense the oldest of all, for here we come face to face with
prehistoric times&mdash;the skeletons of the greater beasts, the flint
weapons of primitive man with practically nothing save the years
to intervene. A lean humanity, untouched by aught save nature,
has run out its appointed course until very recent years; and there
is little to testify to its wanderings but the brown trail of generations
of footsteps, which ten years of disuse would blot out for ever. You
cannot there gaze over the ruins of a once populous city and say,
"Here lived a dead people." No, you can but think by lonely
river or lagoon, "The bygone Indians may here have had their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
camp, or the greater beasts their lair." The netted lakes, the gaunt
Cordillera, the limitless pampa and the unceasing wind&mdash;that
is all. <i>Cañadon</i> follows <i>cañadon</i>, pampa succeeds pampa, you
have the Atlantic to the east of you and the Andes to the west of
you, and between, in all the vast country, beside the Indian trail,
the only paths are game-tracks!</p>

<p>On December 2 we were again short of meat, therefore Jones
and I went hunting. These early mornings upon the high ground
above the lake will never, I think, be forgotten by any of us who
shared them. It was a vivid and pulsating life, and the hunting
was carried on under conditions unique to Patagonia.</p>

<p>In the slight depression through which the River Fenix winds,
herds of guanaco were to be found, each point containing any
number between half a dozen to forty head. On the morning I
write of we were not long in finding our game. A large herd,
including several guanaco <i>chicos</i>, were to be seen from the heights
dotted about upon the faded greenish grass of the valley beneath
us. The sun, newly risen, had just begun to suck up the balls of
white mist that rolled up and down the cuplike hollows, and as
the light strengthened it brought out the gold and white colouring
of the guanacos feeding in the valley. The horse I was riding
had done no work for three weeks, and was fit to gallop for his
life.</p>

<p>The herds were in a place quite inaccessible to stalking, but it
was certain that they would break for the hills to the south.
Immediately they saw us they took to flight in the direction we
expected, and we dashed away to cut them off. The Patagonian
horse soon begins to take an interest of his own in galloping game.
We arrived within two hundred yards of where the herds
had begun to straggle in a long line up the bare side of a range of
round bald-headed hummocks, but we were not in time to get a
shot before they disappeared over the sky-line. When we reached
the top of the hills the guanacos were, of course, nowhere to be
seen, but after an hour's tracking we again located them among
the hummocks in a depression filled with dry thorn. This time
we separated and Jones showed himself at the far end of the gorge,
while I made a circuit and lay down upon the top of a hill towards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
which I thought they were likely to break. This they did the
instant they saw Jones, who got a shot, breaking the leg of one.
I killed another as they passed. We jumped upon our horses to
overtake Jones' wounded guanaco, that was keeping up with the
herd.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_189" id="i_189"></a>
<img src="images/i_189.jpg" width="550" height="413" alt="" />
<p class="caption">STERILE GROUND TO NORTH OF LAKE BUENOS AIRES</p>
</div>

<p>My horse, the Alazan, had recently received some jumping
lessons, and being an animal with no sense of proportion, had been
seized with a mania for jumping everything. Jones nearly fell off
his horse with laughing when the Alazan valiantly charged a
califate-bush, eight feet high and full of thorns, through which he
dashed in one jump and two supplementary bucks. Emerging
upon the other side we set off after our guanaco and enjoyed one
of the most glorious gallops that ever fell to the lot of man. I
could not help admiring the way in which Jones, who was a born
rider, and, like most Gauchos, had lived all his life on the outside
of a horse, picked his way among the great fragments of rock that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
filled the hollows. The Alazan jumped them, and proceeded upon
his appointed path to his own evident satisfaction, the infinite
amusement of Jones, and the terror of myself. However, though
one might take exception to his methods, the Alazan had a turn
for speed and bore my fourteen stone nobly to the front.</p>

<p>Presently the guanaco we were pursuing dashed across a shallow
lagoon and fell upon the farther side of it. As we dismounted we
observed fresh tracks of a wild bull, which was heading north-west
towards the Cordillera. Although we followed these tracks for
twenty miles and came upon ample evidence of their being quite
recently made, evening fell upon us and we were obliged to turn
campwards.</p>

<p>On our arrival we had a look at the horses and sat up late
expecting the return of Barckhausen and Burbury, who had gone
to look for the Indian trail, which the Indians told us led under the
foothills of the Cordillera to the end of the continent. I have
given a description of the trail in another place. It is in its way
as remarkable a highroad as the Grand Trunk Road in India.
Were it not for the tracks of horses, and the occasional dead
camp-fire to which it leads you, it would be impossible to distinguish
it from a series of guanaco-tracks running parallel. Nevertheless,
many an ostrich-hunter has by its aid found his way into
the settlements, when without it he would have wandered far and
wide upon the pampas.</p>

<p>It was not before the next day, however, that Burbury and
Barckhausen returned with the news that they had found the trail
some twenty leagues away near the <i>cañadon</i> of the River Deseado.</p>

<p>I have mentioned my great desire to shoot a huemul
(<i>Xenelaphus bisulcus</i>), and, as we had been disappointed in this
respect in our former expeditions, I decided to penetrate into the
gorge of the River de los Antiguos. We made arrangements for
an absence of some duration from the base camp, leaving Jones
and Burbury in charge.</p>

<p>On the 5th we started, and, while riding to Rosy Camp, saw
columns of smoke arising from amongst the hills on the other side
of the Fenix. We thought they were signals of Indians and
answered them. By here and there burning a bush we signalled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
to the unknown, and in this way drew together. It was upon the
yellow shores of a dry lagoon that we met with the first white man
we had seen since leaving Colohuapi. This man and his errand
were so typical of the country and its methods of life that I do
not apologise for sketching his portrait at full length.</p>

<p>As he came riding towards us we perceived that he was seated
upon a saddle of sheepskins, and rode a yellow horse, whose condition
told its own story. In Patagonia one gets into the habit of
noticing the horse before the rider. The practised eye can learn
from its appearance and condition the answers to at least three
questions. The rider was a very small Argentine, and he had, he
informed us, come up from San Julian. You who do not know
Patagonia may think it strange that one should meet with one's
fellow creatures miles from anywhere, but the Patagonian Gaucho
is in his way unique. He is as much a pioneer of civilisation as
were the fur-clad hunters of the Bad Lands of North America. By
habit and by choice the Gaucho is a nomad. It is not too much
to say that, grumbler as he is when upon the pampas, there is a
deep-seated instinct in his heart ever leading him back to that
peculiar mode of life which has become second nature to him.
There is an idea in England that Patagonia is as untrodden as the
Polar regions. But this is a fallacy. The tides of civilisation are
moving slowly westwards, and will so continue to move until they
are thrown back by the great natural barrier of the Andes. But
as the tide will often fling a little wreath of foam far ahead of its
advance&mdash;a wreath that disappears for the moment perhaps, but
yet its fall has marked a spot that in course of time will be
swept over by the rising water; so in Patagonia these few wanderers
break away from the settlements upon the coast, and set out
with their little store of flour, <i>fariña</i>, and <i>maté</i>, their troop of horses,
and their half-dozen hounds. They say that they are looking for
good ground or, as they call it, good camp to settle upon, but few
of them actually carry out this final intention. It is the free life
that they love, the wild gallops after the ostriches and the
guanacos, the sound slumbers under the stars, and the absence of
all control.</p>

<p>Such a wanderer was our small friend. He had, he said, two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
companions, whom he had lost when running ostriches. As we sat
there upon our horses and looked from the man to the great clouds
of smoke which were arising from the direction of the Fenix, of
which he was the miserable author, one felt inclined to throw him
in his own fire. For whereas, whenever I or my men lit a smoke,
we were careful that it should burn but one bush, and not spread
to scar and disfigure the face of the country, this irresponsible little
being, who had, as it were, ridden to meet us out of the nowhere,
persistently lit his reckless fires among the best grass, so that they
burnt huge areas. It was a remarkable, and in its way a painful,
reflection that this puny bit of humanity with his box of cheap
matches could do more harm in half an hour than he would be
likely to be able to repair during a lifetime. The fact is, a fire will
burn a very small area upon the pampas near the coast, where
there is little for the flames to take hold upon, while here in the
high grass, near the Cordillera, it may rage for two or three days,
devastating and blackening the landscape.</p>

<p>Rather annoyed with the small man, I directed Barckhausen to
ask him why he had lighted so many smokes. He replied that he
had done so in order to recall his companions. As the man was,
after the fashion of the pampa, our guest, there was nothing more
to be said on the matter, but had I foreseen how much trouble his
mania for raising smokes was yet to cause us, I should probably
have remonstrated with him.</p>

<p>That evening, as we rode into Rosy Camp, we saw a number
of flamingos upon the lagoon, and shot an upland goose. The
following morning I woke up in the grey of the dawn to see a Cordillera
wolf nosing among the ashes of our camp-fire. I shot it, to
the great delight of the small man, from whom after breakfast we
parted. We had not advanced a mile before the little demon was
again sending up a smoke to heaven. Burbury, who met him afterwards,
said he believed that he carried a cargo of nothing but
matches in order to be able to indulge to the utmost his passion
for destroying the country through which he happened to be
passing.</p>

<p>On December 7 we arrived above the River de los Antiguos,
and, as we were about to descend the <i>barranca</i>, saw two columns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
of smoke rising some two miles off. Two columns of smoke
close together were our danger-signal, and meant "Something very
wrong, come at once." I was morally certain that they were the
work of the small man, whom we had nicknamed "the Snipe,"
especially as the smokes were lit at a distance from the position of
Horsham Camp, and if anything serious had happened, it seemed
most probable that the two men left in charge there would have
lit their signal-fires on the hill close behind the camp, instead of
riding to some distance for that purpose. However, there was
nothing for it but to send Scrivenor back, with instructions to show
a smoke upon the shore of the lake behind an island in our view
if my presence were really required.</p>

<p>While he returned to Horsham Camp, Barckhausen and I rode
on towards the <i>cañadon</i> of the River de los Antiguos.

</p>

<p>Barckhausen and I continued along the south shore of the lake
until we struck the River de los Antiguos, a small but rapid torrent
flowing through a huge frowning gorge, between very steep
<i>barrancas</i>. Farther to the west a second river, the River Jeinemeni,
runs for some distance almost parallel with it and discharges itself
into the lake some little distance beyond the mouth of the Antiguos.
Between these two rivers lies a tableland, which I was anxious to
visit. We, therefore, looked for a favourable place to descend into
the valley of the River de los Antiguos, and presently discovered
a spot where the cliffs were rather less perpendicular. The
<i>barranca</i>, which was about one hundred and fifty feet in height,
being composed of sliding sand and stones, covered with a high
growth of bushes, presented a troublesome route for the horses.
They had been tied together by their headstalls, the only way in
which it was possible to drive them. It was now necessary to
dismount and take them down singly. Two of them, Mula and
Luna, refused to face the slope, and had to be urged on by persuasions
from behind. When Mula at last consented to begin the
descent, he lost his head and slid down the <i>barranca</i>, almost carrying
Barckhausen, who was pulling at his <i>cabresto</i> from below, with
him.</p>

<p>When we all arrived safely at the bottom, we found the bed of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
the river was formed of large boulders, and progress was consequently
very slow. After a time we forded across, the water
barely reaching to the horses' knees, but flowing so rapidly as to
bring down good-sized tree-trunks with it. We made a camp in a
bare place backed by a deep green forest. After our meal, which
consisted of half an emergency ration each, a couple of two-ounce
dumplings and some tea, we climbed the western <i>barranca</i>, and
discovered an open space in the forest, where the grass rose to our
middles, and we were greeted by the wet smell of earth, to which we
had long been strangers on the dry stretches of the pampas. We
called the spot Rest-and-be-thankful Camp, and at once moved the
horses up to it, and on the way Fritz, who happened to be in an
obstinate mood, lay down among the stones. Little did we think
at the time how often we were destined to climb up and down that
weary <i>barranca</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_195" id="i_195"></a>
<img src="images/i_195.jpg" width="550" height="370" alt="" />
<p class="caption">LAKE BUENOS AIRES FROM THE <i>CAÑADON</i> OF THE RIVER DE LOS ANTIGUOS</p>
</div>

<p>A number of animals live in the Gorge of the River de los
Antiguos. Quite close to the camp I found tracks of wolves,
guanaco, huemul, a wild cat, and the smaller rodents. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
was a little story to be read on the wet sand. A huemul had
come down to drink the preceding evening, and had been stalked
by a puma and her cub. The puma must have been giving her
offspring a lesson in killing. You could see that the puma had
leaped upon the huemul from a neighbouring thicket, and there
had been a struggle. The huemul, however, managed to dash
back into the trees and finally made his escape upon the other
side of the patch of forest.</p>

<p>After resting the night we rode up the Gorge, where we saw
some guanaco and found an ostrich egg. We left the three extra
horses tethered in the camp, and rode along the heights above the
river. The going was bad all the time. Stones, cliffs and rifts
hindered our advance, but presently we began to leave the bush
behind and entered into a bare tract of iron-grey hillsides and
black boulders. Here we stopped for a meal, for which we made
an omelette of the ostrich egg, and ate it powdered with chocolate.
We cooked it in a tin plate with a little mutton-fat, and uncommonly
good we found it.</p>

<p>About two leagues farther on I shot a guanaco, but my desire
was to see a huemul. Every new variety of game was of interest
to us, not only from the zoological point of view, but also from
that of the hungry man, for we had had a very long spell of
guanaco meat. We spent the night in a spot where the horses
fed on some fair grass.</p>

<p>We climbed the highest eminence at dawn and looked out for
a smoke behind the island, but seeing none we pushed on. I was
riding far ahead along the tableland above the river valley when I
saw a huemul. It sprang out from some rocks ahead of me. It
was a young buck, and when he caught sight of me he stood at
gaze. The huemul is one of the most beautiful deer in the world,
although he only carries small spiked horns of no great size. His
summer coat is of a rich reddish-brown, which, when examined
closely, is found to be thickly mingled with white hairs. In shape
huemules are rather strongly built, being about the size of fallow-deer.
I have given a detailed account of the habits of the huemul,
of which no other record exists, in a later chapter, so will say no
more upon that subject here. I was most unwillingly obliged to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
shoot the buck, for we were in need of food. Leaving the meat,
after tying a handkerchief above it to scare away the condors, we
hastened back to fetch the extra horses. We had had scanty diet
for some days, and the thought of a full meal put strength into us.
We were not long in bringing up the remainder of our troop, but
when returning we saw three condors drop suspiciously near the dead
huemul. By the time we arrived there was hardly an ounce of meat
left on the bones, and only the quarter, which we had hidden in the
bushes, remained, even that being a good deal torn and mangled.</p>

</div>

<p>Such as it was, however, we made the best of it, and after
cutting away the damaged parts, found enough for a meal. It
turned out to be the driest, stringiest, worst meat I have ever for
my sins been forced to eat.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>As night fell, the Gorge&mdash;it became <i>the</i> Gorge to us&mdash;assumed
a more and more sinister aspect. Of all the scenes I had up
to that time beheld in Patagonia, this was the most repellent
and inhospitable. The little torrent (which was destined to play
us such a trick), the high iron-grey bluffs and escarpments, the
soaring condors, the scavenger caranchos, and the black shadows
of the Cordillera, made up a picture that was both grand and
menacing.</p>

<p>Next day I shot a guanaco. Very much easier work than it
had been on the pampas. A guanaco would remain lying down
until you were within a long shot, and one actually watched us
and neighed while we discussed our porridge. Man had never,
I fancy, molested them before.</p>

<p>We advanced for a good distance up the river over terribly bad
ground, all boulders and steep cliffs, and then we attempted to ford
to the other side. The two black horses, however, seemed to
have conceived a horror of the river and could not be induced to
cross. They simply made us very wet, and we had to go forward
on foot. We were now within easy distance of the end of the
Gorge, and had joined the route of Von Plaaten<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> from the
south.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>

<p>On December 10 I went out in the evening to shoot something
for the pot. On the first ridge I came to I stalked and
killed a big guanaco buck, putting a bullet into his lungs. Then I
signalled to Barckhausen to come and help to cut him up. As I
waited there in the fading light, wondering at the desolation of
the place, a little huemul buck came bounding along and "paid
the penalty," as the cricket reporters say. I had some trouble
to keep off the condors while I went to some distance to call
Barckhausen.</p>

<p>Altogether the Gorge was not an inviting spot with its hot
marshy valleys and fat stinging flies. After sweating among the
boulders in the lower ground, if we climbed the <i>barranca</i>, the chill
wind from the Cordillera nipped our very bones.</p>

<p>As I sat writing my diary during those days, diabolical-looking
insects with upturned tails used to crawl across the page.</p>

<p>My desire to penetrate farther at that time seemed likely to be
fulfilled, as so far we had seen no warning smoke from the lake
direction. The chief difficulties hindering our advance were the
treacherous footing on the <i>barrancas</i>, which we were obliged to
scale very frequently, and the trouble with the horses both on
them and at the fords.</p>

<p>Finally I decided to leave Barckhausen with the horses and to
walk on as long as food held out, for the boulders made riding
impossible. But next morning, just as I had fixed up my kit
preparatory to starting, a column of smoke began to arise somewhere
in the direction of the lake. We fancied at first it was
Scrivenor, who had come back to rejoin us, and we hastened up
the cliff. But in that clear air distances are very deceptive, and
the smoke, which from the depth of the Gorge had looked so near,
turned out to be on the farther shore of Lake Buenos Aires.
Then we perceived there were two fires throwing up their smoke
in the morning sun&mdash;the "Come-at-once" signal.</p>

<p>We did not loiter, but in a quarter of an hour were climbing
the <i>barranca</i> from our camp. The old game with the horses had
to be gone through again. We made our way straight down the
strip of tableland towards the lake, along the high sliding cliffs of
the river's <i>cañadon</i>. It was a long ride, and as we went along the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
fact became obvious that the river had risen during the night and
was still rising. The waters had grown earth-coloured and large
trees were being hurtled down-stream.</p>

<p>The warm weather which we had been experiencing must have
melted the snows which feed the torrents of the Cordillera.
Rivers inside and in the neighbourhood of the Cordillera vary
during the spring very much in volume, changing in a single day
or night from a mere trickle of water to a torrent 100 yards
in width. In the present instance the River de los Antiguos
had begun to rise in the day while we were hunting. At length we
saw a place where a big shelf of stone and shingle rising in the
middle of the river divided it into two streams. To reach the bank
nearest to this island of shingle it was necessary to climb down
some two hundred feet of an uncommonly nasty slope. On the
way the horses struck a bed of rolling stones and arrived very
suddenly. The gut of the Gorge was choked with green forest
and decaying vegetation; large dead trees, mostly trunks of
antarctic beech, were jammed together, intersected by a dozen
miniature torrents all sluicing down full of water since the melting
of the snows.</p>

<p>Arrived at the river, my horse took the ford at once and went
in straightly to his shoulders. The current was running like a
mill-race&mdash;overstrong for us, but fortunately we had not plunged
in too deeply, and so got back to the shore.</p>

<p>Had it not been for the two smokes, which we had arranged
were not to be used save in the greatest extremity, I should have
made a camp and waited to see if the river would fall. As things
were, it seemed absolutely necessary to cross at once.</p>

<p>We now went a little up-stream, and I stripped off some of my
clothes and waded down into the river. It was so cold that it
took away all feeling from my feet. I had my precious rifle with
me as well as a dear old shot-gun. The strip of water I was about
to cross was quite narrow. I thought of leaving the guns behind
me, but that would have meant another crossing of the river, which
was so cold that it seemed to burn like fire.</p>

<p>I had not reached the middle when my left foot went into a
hole, the current caught me, and the banks began to run backwards.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
As long as the water was deep I stuck to the two guns,
but a little down-stream the river ran through boulders just
awash, and among these I got rather knocked about. I dropped
the shot-gun and clung to the Mauser, which was to us the more
valuable of the two. Lower down the river was a shallow waterfall,
studded with rocks and boulders. My knee caught between
two rocks, and as I was afraid of having my leg broken, and had
sustained rather a bad knock on the back of the head, I let the
rifle go, and, with the help of my hands, got clear. I was washed
down the fall into deeper water, where swimming was possible.
The current carried me a yard down-stream for every inch I made
across it, but in time I reached the end of the bank of shingle
before mentioned.</p>

<p>After all, disappointment awaited me, for I found the second
branch of the river, beyond the shingle bank, was running so
furiously that, unless I had the help of a rope, crossing it would be
too dangerous. Barckhausen could not follow me in any case, as
he was unable to swim, so that eventually I was obliged to cross
back again and rejoin him. On regaining the shore my plight
was sufficiently miserable. I had kept on my shirt and jersey to
save me from the stones, but of course they were soaking. It was
six o'clock in the evening, the sun had lost its power, a cold wind
was blowing, and I had nothing to pass the night in save some oilskins
and my wet clothes; besides, I was rather badly cut about
the head and knees.</p>

<p>I must explain that during my swim Barckhausen had
succeeded in driving the horses into the river, and they were
come to anchor on the shingle island in mid-stream. Our bedding
was upon the back of one of them, and the river was still rising
rapidly. We therefore decided to return to the camp, as being
more sheltered. Barckhausen kindly lent me his shirt, as he
had his vest, coat and great-coat, which were dry. We started
once more to climb that weary two hundred feet of <i>barranca</i>, and
were much beset by rolling stones and sliding sand. Scarcely had
we reached the top when the horses, after standing for an hour
and a half on their mid-stream island, took it into their heads
to turn about and swim back, so we scrambled down our cliff-side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
again and made a camp amongst the sand and bushes. Here I
saw a wild cat with young, the only one I met with in Patagonia.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_203" id="i_203"></a>

<p class="caption">REST-AND-BE-THANKFUL CAMP</p>
</div>

<p>We now reviewed our sleeping accommodation. The blankets
were too wet to be of any service. Barckhausen luckily was in
the habit of carrying a portion of his bedding upon his saddle, and
this had escaped the water and was dry. I had a horse-rug and
a small blanket. It came on a bone-wet night, the most miserable
we had either of us spent.</p>

<p>Besides, I was very anxious about the possible condition of
things at Horsham Camp, for the two smokes must have meant
something serious, and yet we were unable to go to the help
of our comrades. We made some thin porridge for supper and
turned in. All night long the river continued to rise, we could hear
it gulping and swallowing at the sand and shingle of the bank. I
determined to try the higher ford, by which we had originally
crossed, in the morning.</p>

<p>I find the following in my diary, written while the porridge was
cooking:</p>

<p>"<i>December 12.</i>&mdash;Only a sportsman can realise my feelings. At one
fell swoop both my guns, my old friends, gone! The more serious
loss of the two is the Mauser. It has accompanied me upon my
travels 10,000 miles, and was always to be relied on. And now
to fancy it probably glimmering up through the deep waters of
Buenos Aires Lake! Is there any use in saying more? When
we get back to camp I shall have to fall back on the reserve
Mauser, which has no back-sight, or I should say has a back-sight
fastened on with a strip of raw hide. You arrange it before
the shot, and when you have it balanced you loose off, and if the
gun does not misfire you may hit something. How different to
the rifle that is gone! And the shot-gun, which has also departed
with the Mauser, was a gun with a history. Given to my uncle
for gallant services in another part of the world&mdash;a Purdey double-hammerless
12-bore, I regarded it as an heirloom. Why did I
ever bring it to Patagonia? Many a time have I, out of the
shooting season, cuddled the stock and shot imaginary birds, and
dreamed of the phalanx of geese bearing down on me in Scotland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
in the coming October! It is all over. His glittering locks
"clutch the sand," or in fragments he shifts with the waters of the
inhospitable torrent. Oh, my guns! my guns! Well, it was a
congenial death to you, and I am glad to think the Mauser had
killed a couple of Patagonian huemules before he came to his end.
But, sentiment apart&mdash;and there is a great deal of it in this affair&mdash;the
loss is very serious. True I have still at Horsham Camp
four rifles and a shot-gun (two Colts, a Paradox, a 12-bore and the
sick Mauser), but none of them are in the same class with the
lost ones."</p>

<p>Before leaving the camp I went down again to the river brink
to seek for wreckage. Nothing was to be seen save rock and
stone, overturned trees and boulders. My regrets for the losses
which had befallen us were, however, moderated by the reflection
that I might well be thankful I was not personally keeping the two
guns cold company in the bottom of the lake.</p>

<p>We were astir at four o'clock by moonlight, and started three-quarters
of an hour later. To us, knocked about and dog-tired as
we were, the going was difficult. The <i>barrancas</i> seemed endless.
The river was now a yellow flood, crashing and rushing down the
<i>cañadon</i>, bearing trees, bushes, and logs with its whirl and flurry.
When we arrived at the upper ford it was only to find six feet
of water there and a fall formed beyond it&mdash;quite impassable
in fact.</p>

<p>Our position, in the face of this difficulty, was rather a serious
one. We had food for three days, that is, porridge, and though
"parritch is gran' food," it is not, alone, good to work very hard
on. The snows were still melting in the hills, and, given a protracted
period of warm weather, it might be days before the
river would allow of our passing through it. I lit a signal-fire
on the hills in the hope that my party at Horsham Camp would
reply.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_207" id="i_207"></a>
<img src="images/i_207.jpg" width="550" height="389" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Huemul</span> (<i>Xenelaphus bisulcus</i>) <span class="smcap">in Summer Coat</span></p>
</div>

<p>It was possible that our small Argentine friend had again been
lost "running ostriches" and had again lit up half the countryside
to call his companions' attention to that important fact. The only
weapon left us was a broken Colt and the cartridges in it. But
apart from our own position was the far more serious fact that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
our companions were signalling to us to "Come at once&mdash;something
wrong."</p>

<p>All the day through we patrolled the river banks, riding up and
down searching for a ford. About six in the evening we found a
place where an island broke the force of the torrent, and we fancied
the water was falling.</p>

<p>The river everywhere was shut in by high cliffs. At the foot
of the cliff we descended the ground was so soft that the horses
sank, and we had to haul them through. When we came down to
the level of the river, it appeared very different, viewed close at
hand, to the encouraging idea we had formed, even through the
telescope, from the cliffs above. But the set of the current was
for once towards the farther bank, where it culminated in rapids.</p>

<p>I decided to leave the three worst horses, and we found them
a fine stretch of grass and water at Roblé Camp. There we left
them. They fell to feeding very quietly, and we rode away to the
<i>barranca</i> we had so often surmounted that at length we had formed
a road through its bushes.</p>

<p>The river appeared to be still rising, and was at that spot sixty
yards or so broad. Large trees went whirling by us as we waded
down on our horses into the outer plash of the stream. The horses
took it bravely and slowly, tired as they were. We now found
there were two islands, a smaller and a larger one, on our line of
crossing, upon which we rested, and soon nothing remained save
a twenty-foot stream between us and the farther bank.</p>

<p>Once my horse fell but recovered himself. Small blame to
him, brave beast, he had been carrying fourteen stone all day. At
last, after a strenuous moment, the water grew shallower, and we
came out on the farther side into a belt of green scrub.</p>

<p>Luck never comes alone. As we rode on three huemules
dashed out of a glade and I broke the neck of an old buck with
the damaged Colt. I had taken a careful sight for a shoulder-shot!
We cut up the huemul, skinned the head and rode on, and soon
were out of the <i>cañadon</i> of the de los Antiguos River and riding
through the bushes towards our companions. The moon, on her
rising, found us still going, and the camp we made was a dozen
miles from the river.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>

<p>That night we put the horses in splendid grass, and in the
false dawn of the next morning were in the saddle again. We
had about fifty miles to cover before reaching Horsham Camp, and
never in my life have I so regretted my weight as on that day.
About noon, as we were crossing a white dry lake-bed, a column of
smoke went up on Fenix
Ford; our comrades were
then hurrying to us as we
were to them. We answered
at once, and a
couple of hours later perceived
two horsemen on
a distant rise. Two!
Nothing wrong in camp
then! Hurrah! They
turned out to be Scrivenor
and Burbury.</p>

<div class="figright"><a name="i_210" id="i_210"></a>
<img src="images/i_210.jpg" width="390" height="272" alt="" />
<p class="caption">GRASSY CAMP</p>
</div>

<p>At last the <i>vega</i>, two miles out of Horsham Camp, began. I
had ridden so much off my horse that the <i>cinch</i> would not hold
him. An awful wind arose and the country round&mdash;burned by
those miserable Santa Cruz people&mdash;sent up dust in clouds and
blinded us. At last the green tents came in sight, one of which
held, I knew, a reindeer sleeping-bag, wherein was to be found
warmth and sleep.</p>

<p>When we met my first question was, of course, to ask as to
who might be the perpetrator of the two fires we had seen upon
the previous day, and which were still burning.</p>

<p>"As to those," said Burbury, "they must have been lighted by
the little man whom you entertained at the Fenix. He came into
our camp after he left you, as also did his companions. We knew
that you would wonder who had lit the smokes. When we saw
yours, we at once came to meet you." As we rode along towards
our base camp we passed through acres of fire-blackened land and
cursed the small man (his name is still a mystery to us) by bell,
book, and candle. I had carefully informed him that two fires was
our "Come-at-once" signal, and can only suppose that the irresponsible
little creature had forgotten. After all, our resentment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
against the author of our misfortunes was not uncalled for. He
had given Scrivenor a fifty-mile ride, had been the direct cause of
our losing two guns, had made us abandon three horses, and had
given Barckhausen and myself eighty or ninety miles of extra
marches, besides compelling us to cross the River de los Antiguos
when in flood. We had also to thank him for our miserable night
upon the shores of the river. Against all this he had left us a lame
hound which we feared could travel no farther.</p>

<p>His companions had in my absence visited our camp and had
conversed with Burbury. This conversation, however, left us a
much more valuable legacy. One of these men, an Austrian, had
informed Burbury that the Indians had told him of a puma which
lived farther to the south among the foothills of the Cordillera,
and which differed in some essential respects from the grey puma
of the plains. He described it as being "of a reddish colour, more
fierce than the silver puma, and much smaller!" This was the
first time I heard of the animal now named <i>Felis concolor pearsoni</i>,
of which I afterwards was fortunate enough to obtain a skin.</p>

<p>When we arrived in camp, which we did late upon that afternoon,
we ourselves as well as our horses were pretty well tired out, but
a couple of days in the tent, a tin of cocoa, and some ointment for
the cuts received from the rocks in the river, soon reinvigorated
us, and we were ready to start for the River de los Antiguos, the
scene of our petty disasters, once more.

</p>

<p>On December 16, the interval having been taken out by me in
sleeping off my chill and fatigue, Scrivenor, Jones and I made a
start to retrieve the horses abandoned in the Los Antiguos
<i>cañadon</i> by Barckhausen and myself. We each took a horse and
a spare animal which carried the tent, for the weather was breaking
to the westward. It was our intention to ride the fifty miles back
on the horses which we had left behind in the Gorge.</p>

<p>On arriving at the Fenix we were delighted to find that its
waters had fallen considerably, and that the pebbly bank in mid-stream,
at the ford by Rosy Camp, was once more visible. Almost
upon our old camping-ground we found, as we rode over the sand-hills
by the lake, a pair of guanaco feeding. Jones dismounted
and had a couple of shots, neither of which took effect. The
animals had, however, not perceived Scrivenor and myself, and
came past us upon the shores of the lake, and here Jones and I
ran down and met the female, killing her after a long chase, which
ended by her trying to swim out into the lake.</p>

<p>Upon the evening of the second day we saw again the ill-fated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
River de los Antiguos, and striking south we made a camp,
as nearly as I could judge, opposite to where I had spent the night
shivering in oilskins. Of course, at starting, the question had been
mooted: Might we not, provided the river had fallen sufficiently,
find the lost guns, and at any rate that treasure, the Mauser?</p>

<p>The probabilities were, of course, very much against such good
fortune, and it was almost certain, that even did we find either of
them, it would be useless after being knocked about by the violent
handling of the river.</p>

<p>Immediately we arrived at the Gorge of the de los Antiguos,
Jones and I rode down to the water's edge. I had small hope of
success as regarded retrieving the guns, but the water had fallen
as quickly as it had risen. We soon came upon my tracks going
down to the stream, made during my last visit. We then rode
along the bank. Trees, sand and <i>débris</i> filled the river-bed,
and I had reached a spot some hundred yards below the place
where I had been beached on the shingle island, and Jones was
still engaged in searching another channel, when I saw something
brown upon a sandbank.</p>

<p>There, half in and half out of the water, lay the Mauser, caked
with rust, choked with sand and pebbles, but whole, unbent,
though the stock was pitted with the battering of many stones.
I picked it up, and there seemed but little hope of its ever becoming
serviceable again. However, the sights, by a miracle, were
intact, save the half of the bead of the foresight. After this we
resumed our search, hoping with luck to come upon the shot-gun,
and presently we discovered that also, lying half-buried among
the wreckage at the lip of the flood. Being in a case, it was
practically undamaged. We carried the two in triumph to the
camp. Upon examination the Mauser bolt was found to be fixed
and immovable, and we feared it would never fire again. For
tools we had only an axe and a weak pocket-knife, but with the
help of these two we took the Mauser to pieces, cleaned it, and
fixed it together again, to find, however, that it would not stay on
cock. As soon as we shut the bolt, the rifle went off. We examined
it, but could discover nothing broken or bent, and, night
falling, we went to bed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<p>I was awakened by Jones with the welcome news that breakfast
was ready, and that he had got up early and been at work upon
the Mauser, which he said had haunted his dreams. It was, he
declared, as good as ever, and this proved to be the case. The
trigger had been slightly bent, and a small stone lodged in the
mechanism had been overlooked in the bad light of the previous
evening. Altogether the affair stands out as one gigantic piece
of luck.</p>

<p>It was not now at all a presentable weapon. It was, indeed, an
object any gunmaker would have shied at, but it started business
again by taking a particular stone out of the neighbouring cliff
with all its old accuracy. To celebrate the event we made a plum
duff of flour, which we ate with a tin of Swiss milk. Afterwards
we made quite a bag of pigeons (<i>Columba maculosa</i>), which
frequented the scrub of the river in great numbers.</p>

<p>Patagonia is a land so far from shops that one must not lose
anything, and if you do lose anything, it is strange how persistent
one becomes in looking for it. Scrivenor once rode twenty-five
miles for a pipe; I have spent half a weary day following my old
tracks for a similar purpose. I think the only article lost upon
the expedition, and left lost, was Barker's large knife, and we
had ridden fifty miles the day he dropped it. Jones lost a
pair of pipes one day galloping, and after four days searching&mdash;at
odd times&mdash;found them both again! Burbury lost a knife at
the Fenix River&mdash;but I might go on multiplying instances for
ever.</p>

<p>Well, now that we had found the guns, remained the horses,
and after these we started next morning, moving our small camp
up to where they had been abandoned.</p>

<p>I remember that day, for I was riding the roughest horse in
all our troop, a stout little Zaino, which shook and vibrated like a
miniature torpedo-boat. At length we came to the high <i>barranca</i>
above the river, down which Mula had fallen and nearly immolated
poor Barckhausen. We human beings toboganned down&mdash;the
measured angle being 38°&mdash;and the horses slid down upon their
haunches. Part of the cliff accompanied us in our descent. Then
followed that nasty boulder-strewn piece of journeying I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
before described, until at length we crossed the river and rode in
among the trees towards Rest-and-be-thankful Camp.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_215" id="i_215"></a>
<img src="images/i_215.jpg" width="550" height="421" alt="" />
<p class="caption">DESCENDING THE <i>BARRANCA</i></p>
</div>

<p>That was one of the most picturesque camps which fell to our
lot in Patagonia. The grass there, though coarse, was very good;
deep green scrub and incensio bushes bounded it on three sides,
the <i>barranca</i> leading up to the tableland being on the fourth.
As we were riding through the trees we discovered the three
horses, led by Fritz the Zaino, descending the <i>barrancas</i> to water.
Truly our snakes were standing upright, as the Zulus say. Of
course, immediately the horses under General Fritz perceived us,
they stood still. Before that they were coming down the steep
side of the cliff with the grace and swing of wild things, now they
at once pretended that it was a very difficult business. We caught
them, and found them to be in excellent condition, glossy, bright-eyed
and fat. We at once put them upon <i>sogas</i>, lest their love of
liberty might have been increased by the week-end they had spent
alone. They were evidently in the habit of drinking each evening
and feeding in the rich grass of the Gorge, and in the morning
ascending to the tableland and enjoying themselves there.</p>

<p>After settling the camp, Jones and I saddled up Luna and
General Fritz and went up to look for a guanaco. We found that
the fire lit by Barckhausen and myself had burned over a largish
area and driven the game backwards into the higher basaltic
hills. Among these, and upon the western river, the Jeinemeni,
we had a most lovely evening. Fresh horses, keen air, a soft
wind out of the west, and the most glorious of views&mdash;the lake,
placid for once, in its gigantic setting of peaked and pinnacled
Cordillera, the tint of yellow marshes in the lowland, and the whole
background of the picture painted with mist and distance in a
dozen shades of dusky and far-off blue.</p>

<p>In the course of that day's wanderings we first reached the
Jeinemeni, the more westerly river, which shut in the farther side
of the tableland. The ravine through which it flowed down to the
lake was magnificent, a wonderful vista of broken white cliffs.
The conformation of its <i>cañadon</i> was very different to that of the
de los Antiguos. Seen from a distance the valley appeared
almost treeless, and upon its west bank rose the lower hills of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
Cordillera into needles and peaks of red rock and virgin snow. The
plateau between the rivers we found to be an excellent game
country. Upon a fast horse the ground was good enough, though
rather too broken to admit of "running" young guanaco, one of
the finest and most exhilarating pastimes that I have ever enjoyed.</p>

<p>There is an element in Patagonian hunting quite unique: so
much depends upon your horse. There were but two in all our
forty-seven which could be trusted to stand and not gallop off
when we fired. These two I trained myself on the way up from
Trelew to Colohuapi, and they were a great ease and comfort to
me. But to go shooting on a wild horse, then probably to find
your game in a bushless country, where you are quite unable to
shoot because you cannot tie up your mount, is a most disappointing
affair. Also you have on many occasions to gallop down your
game&mdash;if you hit it a little too far back, for instance. Wearier work
than chasing a wounded guanaco afoot over the bald and endless
ridges of the pampas, or up and down the steep unstable slides of a
<i>barranca</i>, I do not know.</p>

<p>With my trained horse the Cruzado, and the Little Zaino, all
that was necessary was just to drop to the ground&mdash;you could rein
up in the middle of a fast canter and slip off&mdash;the horse would stand
where you left him until you came for him again. There were
others, of course, who, if you loosed the <i>cabresto</i>, were off to camp
at a gallop, and where quickness is so important, they made sport
a little of a penance.</p>

<p>But to return to our first visit to the Jeinemeni. In the <i>cañadon</i>
we came upon a guanaco, and I stalked him. The bullet took
effect, and the poor beast plunged into the abyss below. We
followed him down a few hundred feet, but finding the way beset
with loose stones, and, consequently, on the raw bare cliff, rather
dangerous, we returned with much toil to our horses. It had taken
us one and three-quarter hours to climb five hundred feet.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_219" id="i_219"></a>
<img src="images/i_219.jpg" width="550" height="406" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Guanacos descending a hillside.</p>
</div>

<p>"Any horse, even that old Fritz, is better than a man's own
legs," said Jones feelingly. Arrived in time&mdash;the fulness of time&mdash;at
the top of the cliff, we sat down and rested. As we were
doing so Jones perceived a cloud of dust uprising in the valley
and drew my attention to it. It was coming towards us, but we were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
quite unable at that distance to make out the cause of it. We
marked the place and I took a couple of bearings, and in the early
dark we rode back into camp.</p>

<p>The next morning we <i>sogaed</i> up the horses and set out.</p>

<p>We wanted some meat, having only a little left of the last
guanaco. We saw a number of guanacos on the hills and one
half-grown one, which we attempted to gallop, but had to desist, as
the ground was too false for the horses, and the basalt rocks and
hills told in the guanaco's favour. At length, quite near the spot
where I had shot one on the previous evening, we found a big old
buck standing alone, and we speedily made a plan of campaign. I
rode round and hid in the rocks far above him. Scrivenor tried
stalking him and Jones headed him off from the north.</p>

<p>He went towards Jones, who sent a bullet through his heart at
good range.</p>

<p>Immediately on our killing, the condors, caranchos, and chimangos
began to gather and almost to drop upon the meat in our
presence. I have before remarked on the number of these uncanny
birds which haunted the Gorge. They were huge, black, ragged,
bald, wrinkled, and offensive in odour, incarnations of lust and evil.
The horrible flesh-colour of the bare skin on head and neck was
glassy and livid. And how wonderful was their instinct! You
shot your game, and within a few minutes a condor appeared far
away in the heavens; then another and another! Perhaps they
had some signal bidding to the feast.</p>

<p>Having cut up the guanaco, we descended into the <i>cañadon</i>
of the Jeinemeni, where we had on the previous evening seen the
rising dust&mdash;which meant the movement of living things. At first
it was one of the nastiest of horseback climbs, all loose stones, and
sand and sandstone chippings. The gorge below us was a chessboard
of small-looking round folds set in the bases of the higher
hills and hummocks. Among these were many boulders, with two
or three deep black waterholes, eye-shaped; and, of course, there
were condors. We arrived at the place where we had perceived
the cloud of dust. A large herd of guanaco had passed at the
gallop, as was evident from the tracks.</p>

<p>We rode on to the gorge of the Jeinemeni and made our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
camp by a little pool. Here we had a <i>maté</i> by the fire and gave
our horses grass. Then came our climb up the ragged cliffs by
which we had descended. They were very high, rising fold on
fold, set as always with loose stones and shifting sand, a needle
or two of black rock sticking
out gauntly from their

<p class="caption">FIRST HUEMUL CAMP</p>
</div>

<p>The next day Jones
and I went hunting. We
desired to secure a few
heads and skins of the
huemul and we determined
to devote a day to that
purpose. I will describe
that excursion at full
length, as it was one typical
of Patagonian sport.</p>

<p>Of course we rode. You ride everywhere in Patagonia. I
rode Luna, and Jones one of the Zainos&mdash;Fritz the younger, a very
rough horse.</p>

<p>When we started a light rain was falling and the summits of the
Cordillera were purple with threatening cloud. The rain gave the
mountain wind the softness which the <i>pampero</i> lacks. We quickly
crossed the lower hills and saw some guanacos in the valleys.
We did not shoot any but rode on upwards until we came to the
high ground, where bushes of <i>maté negra</i> and black fragments of
basalt made a desolate picture with the low clouds rolling over the
wet hills. Presently a cloud enveloped us and we took shelter
beneath a rock. It looked as if we were in for a wet day, but to
our delight, after an hour of waiting the wind blew away the clouds
and showed the pale blue sky beyond, the weather turned colder
and set in fine. We jumped on our horses and jogged on until
the high ground was reached. Here we dismounted and spied the
country with the telescope. We had come to the conclusion that
nothing was in sight when, moving a little higher, I saw an ostrich
in a marsh not more than two hundred yards away. The bird had
not perceived us, and fortunately the ground was favourable for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
stalking. Under cover of a hummock, we advanced to within
about seventy yards, when I shot the bird. As always happens,
on receiving the shot it ran thirty yards forward and fell.</p>

<p>During the whole of our travels we observed but one kind of
rhea (<i>Rhea darwini</i>). The remarks that Darwin makes concerning
the habits of this bird have little to be added to them. The
male bird, which hatches out the young, will, when approached,
feign to be wounded in order to draw off the intruder from the
nest of the chicks. I have never seen more than nineteen chicks
with a single ostrich at any period within a month or two of the
hatching, but I was informed by the Gauchos that this number
is not an outside limit. When started, <i>Rhea darwini</i> does not
usually open his wings, as does the <i>Rhea americana</i>. This fact
has been noticed by Darwin. On one occasion, shortly after
leaving Trelew, we chased an ostrich, which, having run a couple
of hundred yards, opened its wings. We did not, however, secure
the bird.</p>

<p>Only when with young will the ostrich, on starting, expand
the wings, but, as I have said, this is a ruse; yet I have seen them
proceed for a short distance with wings full open at times when
hard pressed. In the present instance we cut up our ostrich,
taking the stomach, which, cooked as an <i>asado</i>, or roast, is esteemed
a luxury by the Gauchos. The stomach was full of the grass of
the marsh. Up to the end of December we found eggs. When
fresh they were of a transparent and pale green, which after some
days merged into a pallid white.</p>

<p>While we were yet engaged in cutting up the bird, the neck-skin
of which came in very usefully as a tobacco-pouch, we paused
in the work and took a look round with the telescope. On the
heights above us, two brown objects were to be descried, which
on examination proved to be huemules. They had evidently
seen us, and their curiosity had been excited by our movements.
Hesitatingly they began to descend the hillside towards us. We
cut some antics and so decoyed the unlucky animals within range.
After killing them, we took the skins of both, as there is no example
of this deer in summer coat in any of our British collections.
They were still shedding their winter coat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>

<p>After riding on, our next spy showed us a young huemul buck
beneath us, but as I had already secured a specimen I was only
too glad to let him go in peace.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I cannot give my readers any interesting story
of huemul-shooting; that will be reserved for the pen of some
future traveller, who will find the animal wild, because used to man
and his ways. As for our experience of them, the interest turns
rather on their confidingness and their behaviour towards man as
an unknown entity.</p>

<p>We were riding home, my desire to shoot huemul completely
evaporated, when we perceived among the basalt fragments above
us the black face of a really magnificent buck. In approaching
him I purposely gave him the wind. He had not seen us, but
immediately on getting our wind dashed away to a short distance.
On my showing myself, he stood quite still, snorted twice or thrice,
and was just bounding off when the crack of the Mauser cut short
his career.</p>

<p>There were by this time thirty or forty condors already
gathered upon the carcases of the two we had previously slain.
Indeed in no part of Patagonia did we see such numbers of
<i>Sarcorhamphus gryphus</i> as among these hills. I understand that
there is in Paris a considerable demand for the feathers of the
condor. Here is the place to find them. On our homeward way
we saw two huemul does and a pricket. They stayed and
stared at us as we rode down the lower levels. When nearing
camp a couple of guanacos started over a cliff within ten yards of
us, and descended the sheer hillside, giving me an excellent
opportunity of observing their extraordinary movements. All the
huemules we had shot were so lean as to be practically useless for
the pot, so when later on we came in sight of a herd of guanaco,
and Jones asked me if he might have a shot, I said yes. He
picked out one and bowled it over at three hundred paces with my
Mauser. He was very delighted with his success, and said that
the Mauser was better than any of the guns in Chubut.</p>

<p>On the day after, the river, upon which we had been keeping a
very careful watch, again began to rise. So we packed up and
camped that night in the end of the <i>cañadon</i> near the spot where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
I had shot my first huemul. Although we hunted during the
afternoon we saw nothing, but on the following day, when starting
for our ride, we sighted three huemules, two does and a young
buck, in the scrub of a stream which enters the lake some miles to
the east of the River de los Antiguos. In the evening of that
day, after fording the River Fenix, and about eight miles out of
Horsham Camp, a huemul buck dashed across about a couple of
hundred yards ahead of us, and I, taking a very hasty aim, was
fortunate enough to bring him to the ground. We had difficulty
for a few moments in finding him, as he had gone head over heels
into some scrub in a fissure of the hillside.</p>

<p class="caption">THE OFF-SADDLE</p>
</div>

<p>During this hunting trip, which I have described, we neither
desired nor endeavoured to make a large bag; in fact, I think that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
one could very easily over that ground shoot ten huemules and an
indefinite number of guanaco in one day, but such a proceeding
would be little short of a crime. Very different indeed were
my experiences after wild cattle, which I followed steadily at a
later date of the expedition, for eleven days before I had any
chance of a shot.</p>

<p>Another good hour of the day during our expedition was that
when, pretty tired, one rode into camp, and saw the little green
tent pitched among the tussocks, the horses scattered round, the
big black pot upon the fire. You drank your <i>maté</i>, smoked a
pipe while the black pot boiled, and you talked over the day's
doings. And so on until dark began to fall, and in the night you
could hear the sounds of the open, the rush of some river, the
moaning of wind across the plain or through the forests&mdash;when
near the Cordillera&mdash;perhaps the cries of wildfowl, or the whistle
of the Chiloe widgeon as the shadows closed down. Then came
preparations for the morrow&mdash;the beans were cut, the meat put
on, the fire raked up about to-morrow's breakfast; and presently
you turned in, the shadows waxed and waned, and when you woke
the stars were paling in the western sky.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Horsham Camp</span>, <i>Christmas Day, 1900</i>.&mdash;Here the weather is
warm; large, soft and poisonous flies haunt the marsh in the
camp. The horses neigh. An ostrich, the greatest delicacy of
wild game in Patagonia, hangs with three legs of guanaco on the
meat gallows." So runs my diary.</p>

<p>We spent a very humble Christmas up there at Little Horsham
Camp, and made what mild cheer we might. In the morning of
Christmas Day we had horse races, a mile and a half-mile. We
rode the best horses in our respective troops. Barckhausen, however,
rode the Azulejo, which he decorated with a towel and a red
handkerchief, to our great amusement. We were almost ready for
the second race when he came in from the first, having had a
difference of opinion on the way with his steed, which thought it
would be much nicer to rejoin his friends and companions feeding
on the green marsh than to run races.</p>

<p>The surprise of the day was the winning of the races by the
Little Zaino, as we christened him. He was very timid and wild
to saddle and mount, but once up he proved himself a treasure.
In appearance he was a comely enough little horse, plump and
well picked up, and had been used occasionally to carry a cargo on
the way to the lake.</p>

<p>The day before Christmas I wanted to go for a bathe, so I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
caught our little friend, and, liking his pace, let him stretch himself
a little on the way back over the edge of the marsh. He stretched
himself to such good purpose that he was ridden in the next day's
races and won the three events, although he was carrying a stone
and a half more than the others! Our course lay through a belt
of thick bushes, but, barring these, was good enough. At any
rate, it turned out excellent fun, and we all enjoyed our races.</p>

<p>The only one of us who did not get a prize was riding a horse
which came to us with rather a bad name, and which, immediately
the others started, dashed back to the troop.</p>

<p>During the afternoon we made up our cargoes ready for the
morrow's start, after our Christmas dinner, of which I print the
menu:</p>

<p>In the evening after dinner we indulged in some shooting

</div>

<p>On December 26 we bade good-bye to Horsham Camp. After
a long interval the <i>cargueros</i> were once more loaded up, and the
whole troop tailed away to the eastward. Is any sight sadder
than a deserted camp? The dead or dying camp-fire, the broken
remains of food surprised by the sun, the litter, the bare rubbed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
grass, and the occasional fox. We left some tins of corned beef
behind us, as I hoped to travel very fast to Santa Cruz. That day
we made anything from eight to ten leagues, and camped in Seven
Ostriches <i>cañadon</i>, the spot that Barckhausen and I had previously
visited and named after the birds we saw there.</p>

<p>The following day (27th) we made a good march and encamped
by a lagoon, upon which I shot two yellow-billed teal, and Jones
and Burbury four ducks, which were plucked before we came into
camp. On the morning after a very difficult part of our journey
commenced. All day we travelled over a pampa covered with
basaltic fragments and thorny bushes; some of these bushes bore
a red tulip-like flower.</p>

<p>Enormous numbers of guanaco haunt these grim plateaus.
Jones and I galloped a half-grown one, and killed it with the help
of a dog. The going was extremely bad, our path lying through
gorges and up steep-sided ridges, rough with basaltic fragments
and powdered with sharp clinkers of lava. It is not easy to
describe the changing fortunes of such a day. For instance, we
were turned again and again by gullies and rifts in the hollows of
the hills, and, what with shifting cargoes on these cruel and almost
perpendicular slopes, the difficulty of keeping the troop of horses
straight and of taking care of one's own limbs, was extreme.
Literally thousands of guanaco appeared on the summits of the
surrounding barren ridges, and fled galloping down the rock-faces
with jerking necks and flying hoofs. Sometimes the old bucks
would come and look at us, running towards us and neighing and
laughing, and then ducking their long necks and cantering off.
What they lived on in so sterile a region still remains a mystery
to me.</p>

<p>I saw one condor poised high.</p>

<p>Our Indian <i>baqueano</i>, Como No, had told us that we must
strike "between two hills." Barckhausen asserted that he had
indicated to him a couple of round peaks on the summit or rather
forming the culminating-points of this high basalt range. We
made our way up these monstrous steps, as it were, of rock, steering
by the compass, and after some twenty miles of travelling
found ourselves upon a bare black highland over which the wind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
was tearing in heavy gusts. No wood, no water, no grass. I was
afraid we should have to remain there for the night, and also afraid
that Mrs. Trelew, the <i>madrina</i> of the Trelew troop, whose udder
was big, might drop her foal in that sterile spot. Another danger
which menaced us, was that the horses would certainly become
lame if they had to travel far over these broken rocks. We therefore
rode on perhaps another fourteen miles, and the dark was
falling when we found a camp in a <i>cañadon</i>&mdash;a bad approach
strewn with basalt fragments, but a fair camp at the end with a
little stream and good grass.</p>

<p>On December 29 the Trelew mare dropped her foal, a little
disproportionately-boned, huge-jointed <i>alazan</i> filly. During the
day Scrivenor and I explored the <i>cañadon</i> and I shot a guanaco
and an ostrich. The guanaco was a very father of guanacos, old,
scarred, black-faced and war-worn. His meat was worse than that
of a he-goat.</p>

<p>To all sides of us stretched the limitless expanses of basalt,
and our outlook was not a cheerful one. An examination of the
horses' hoofs convinced us that another day's marching such as the
last would work great havoc amongst them. I did not know how
far this wilderness of basalt might extend, so on December 30 set
out with Burbury to attempt to find its boundary.</p>

<p>Our intention had been to strike the Indian trail under the
Cordillera and follow it until we reached the neighbourhood of the
River Belgrano, when we would keep the course of that river to
its junction with the River Chico, which in its turn would lead us
down to the settlement of Santa Cruz, our destination. When I left
the Cordillera I had made up my mind to return to them farther
south at the Lake Argentino near lat. 50°. To cover a large area
of country, and at the same time to collect specimens, is a physical
impossibility. I had therefore decided to leave Scrivenor at Santa
Cruz to collect fossils in that vicinity, while I myself again crossed
the continent to the Andes, some part of which I hoped to explore,
and my dreams were not uninfluenced by the stories of the red
puma, of the existence of which, however, Scrivenor was very
dubious.</p>

<p>Such, then, were the reasons that were taking us to the eastern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
coast, and my desire was to arrive there as soon as possible in
order to have plenty of time to carry out my projects before winter
made travelling of any kind impossible. Once we reached the
River Belgrano our difficulties would be over, that we knew; but
in order to attain this end we had to pass through a region somewhat
waterless and stony
lying on the verge of the
basalt wilderness, into which
we had strayed.</p>

<div class="figright"><a name="i_233" id="i_233"></a>
<img src="images/i_233.jpg" width="350" height="242" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE INDIAN TRAIL</p>
</div>

<p>To get away from this
basalt region was, of course,
our first desire. Could we
but find the Indian trail, which
we were sure must be at no
great distance, and which
stretches, leading one from
camp to camp, all the way
from Lake Buenos Aires to Punta Arenas, with a branch in the
direction of Santa Cruz, our troubles would be at an end. Owing,
however, to the lessening number of Indians, the track is now only
clearly visible for half a mile at a time in the neighbourhood of
fords and other difficult places.</p>

<p>To return to our search. Burbury and I had started early.
The going at first was over basalt clinker, fearful for the horses'
feet, but presently we came to a low round hillock of pebble&mdash;a
hopeful sight, for I had been half afraid we might be deep in the
basalt wilderness. Following on we discovered other pebbly
hillocks, on one of which I found a single horse-track, stamped
when the ground was soft some time previously. After a while,
as we rounded a slope, we saw a bit of green camp. We were
bearing a little west of south, and there we struck the full Indian
trail&mdash;that wonderful trail, which runs league after league, worn
by the footsteps of generations upon generations of Indians as
they migrated up and down the length of the country with their
women and children, their guanaco-skin tents and their few
possessions.</p>

<p>The trail is much like a guanaco-track, or rather like several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
running side by side. So the Tehuelches leave their footmarks,
which resemble those of the game they live by, and they leave
little else to show to those who come after, that here hundreds
of men have existed through the centuries, knowing such joys and
sufferings as lie between birth and death, only a trodden line across
the waste and a few burnt
bushes by the wayside.</p>

<img src="images/i_234.jpg" width="356" height="251" alt="" />
<p class="caption">RIVER OLIN</p>

</div>
<p>We rode back to the camp,
and decided to try the little
filly with a short march, as
much delay was out of the
question. The horses all appeared
to be interested in the
arrangement, and refused to
be driven unless the filly led.
This she did, making her
first journey trotting beside
her mother. We had to cross a ford, and Barckhausen brought
the filly over gently by the ear, Mrs. Trelew objecting extremely
to such treatment of her offspring. We are all very careful and
tender over our loose-limbed baby. During the short march we
saw many guanacos.</p>

<p>The duration of the expedition might be divided into periods:
first, the biscuit period, when every one toasted biscuits, hard
camp biscuits, shiny and of a great size; followed by the dumpling
period. Now it was the damper period, which was the most
appetising of them all.</p>

</div>

<p>On the last day of the year we managed seven leagues, and
camped in a bare <i>cañadon</i>. New Year's Day we covered eight
leagues of bare and arid steppes of pampa. At this time we had
a great deal of hunting. A lame dog, left behind by our Argentine
ostrich-hunter, turned out to be excellent for sport. We named
him Chichi. We camped by a lagoon of muddy water with a thin
strip of feed half encircling it, but the grass was rich with seed.
Mirages haunted our marches through this desolate region. This
chapter might be called "Through the Land of Distant Hills."
There was a savage loneliness between those wide horizons that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
thrust itself upon you. One felt a mere atom, and the thought of
finding oneself condemned to live there alone seemed too awful to
face. The bare, round-headed hills looked old and bald, eternal
winds (though not so strong as nearer to the lake) whistled sadly
as before, and on all sides pampa pebbly and grassless, ridge on
ridge, horizon on horizon, mirage on mirage.</p>

<p>Suddenly, during that night, the sky became black over the
distant Cordillera and the rain began. Immediately we slung up
the tents. Oh, those tents, what a comfort they were at the end of
a weary march! We had no adequate poles and no bushes or pegs
to hang them upon, but we got them up somehow and put the
cargo round them. Then we crept inside and listened to the rain.
The warm beds, the rugs, the candle and tobacco and books. It
was homelike. And the dry shirt one could put on within that
shelter, with the rain, rain outside! When you have slept out in
all weathers you begin to understand the full luxury of a tent like
ours, with its furs and warmth and a decent pipe out of the wind.
It is a moving home. To be free of the weather, to let it rain if
it wants to, to lie and listen to it, these are all thrilling pleasures,
pleasures because of the contrast to the wet open camp where, in
spite of the covered and sweating head and body, the pitiless rain
trickles in pools into your bed. And the spell of reading at night
inside the tent, the company of thoughts new and old of wise men,
these are pleasures of which only the wanderer knows the true
sweetness.</p>

<p>During the next day or two we continued to travel over the
same waterless stony pampa; there were pigmy hillocks, many
guanaco and a lagoon of wonderful shades of blue, also the wind
ahead, and dust blowing back into our eyes. We crossed the
River Olin and pushed on for the River Chico. One cold night
as we sat round the fire some one suggested we should have an
exhibition of our effects when we reached Santa Cruz. Beyond a
broken cup or two, a <i>bombilla</i>, and a shattered kettle, we could
produce little else. It was hinted that Barckhausen's trousers
might figure in it, and I offered to contribute my old coat.</p>

<p>Before reaching the River Belgrano we came in sight of a
troop of horses being driven across the pampa by a couple of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
Gauchos. At first sight we thought them a mirage. On inquiry
I was told that my friend Señor Waag was in command, news
at which I was naturally delighted. I had made Mr. Waag's
acquaintance in Buenos Aires, and we had arranged to meet in
Patagonia if possible. Mr. Waag was on the Argentine Boundary
Commission, and has done more valuable geographical work in the
Cordillera than any other man. Being told that he was only a
couple of hours behind the troop, I galloped on to meet him, for I
heard that his waggon had broken down, and so made sure of
coming upon him. After a few hours going, I arrived at the
camp of his assistants, where were two Italian engineers, and also
some piratical-looking <i>peones</i> in red caps making bread in an oven
dug into the ground. But Mr. Waag himself was not there,
having gone off the track to camp in a <i>cañadon</i>. I was greatly
disappointed, for I had looked forward to this meeting.</p>

<p>However, we were greedy to hear news of the outer world,
from which we had been cut off for four months. We were far
behind the times. I think our first question was about the war
and Kruger. We learned that he was in Europe and that guerilla
warfare was still going on. The Italians' news only carried up to
November.</p>

<p class="caption">THE ITALIAN ENGINEERS' WAGGON</p>
</div>

<p>We made our camp a little way from theirs, and our hounds
strayed over to them and stayed with their waggons, deserting us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
altogether. As for ourselves, we were most kindly entertained by
the Italian engineers, and enjoyed the luxuries of a tin of butter,
biscuit, bread, tea, milk, sugar and some cognac. Flies abounded
and bothered us as we ate our meal on a packing-case, an ostentatious
comfort which made us feel very civilised.</p>

<p>We were now in the valley of the Chico, which is a large
stream with a swift current, its <i>cañadon</i> bordered with bare ridges.
It felt like old times to be in a river valley once more, reminding
us of those we had passed through on our way to Lake Buenos
Aires. We saw geese again, of which I shot two, and also a
pigeon. The valley here was very rich with red seed-bearing grass,
and beyond, nearer to the water, a glorious green <i>pantano</i>, dotted
with deep clear pools.</p>

<p>Before parting with the Italians they presented us with some
sugar and I gave them some tea and tobacco. The valley
through which we marched continued to be very fertile. The
grass was like that of an English meadow with sweet far-off
scents, but lacking the dewiness of our English scents of wood
and wold.</p>

<p>On January 7 we travelled eleven leagues, taking a short cut
through a bare <i>cañadon</i> of dry mud-hills. Leaving this behind us
we again came in sight of the River Chico and crossed a high
pampa of yellow tussocks and gravel. The morning dawned hot
with the usual accompaniment of mosquitoes and sand-flies. As
we sighted the river this heat gave place to a fresh rain-smelling
wind, inexpressibly grateful.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, as we rode along, there appeared against the
sky a keen peak of rock&mdash;Sierra Ventana. We had long been
looking forward to our first glimpse of it, knowing it would be a
sign that we were nearing civilisation. Blue, distant, perhaps
thirty miles away, behind the basalt hills, it raised its strange
castle-like head, only the castle is of nature's building, not man's.
I think we all welcomed this token of the old kindly inhabited
world again, after our months spent on houseless plains and
inhospitable mountains.</p>

<p>A herd of guanaco some twenty strong showed at almost the
same moment. I galloped forward, feeling glad that our dinner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
no longer depended on my shot. I was a mere sportsman once
more. The doe I shot had fat on her, the first we had seen
during our wanderings, "just as we've got the chance of fat mutton,
too," as someone remarked. Rain fell at night, and the wind blew,
but with the razor-edge of cold off. We camped in some flowering
grasses with the bare steppes of the pampa on one side and
the dark hills on the other; behind these, among some bright
streaks in the stormy billowy sky, the Sierra Ventana thrust up
its crest.</p>

<p class="caption">THE HOME OF THE INDIAN WHO GAVE US MUTTON</p>
</div>

<p>Next day we came upon a hut of Indians, who gave me some
mutton, for which they would accept no payment. Perhaps they
did not like to take money from a man in so old a coat! I, however,
gave them some tobacco.</p>

<p class="caption">SIERRA VENTANA</p>
</div>

<p>Later we came upon a bush-shelter of some tender of sheep
and cattle. It was a forlorn little place&mdash;just a hut of poles and
bushes and skins by the river bank. It was doorless, and the
dweller must have been a very small man, judging by his bed,
which was a hole in the earth, pillowed with a broken wooden
cargo-saddle. On one of the props was fastened a card with the
word "<i>Salido</i>" (Gone out). A bag of canvas, old and stained,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
was tied up to the roof, a cracked tiny mirror hung from the
central pole. He seemed to have no provisions, only a bag of
<i>yerba</i>. He had recently killed a lion, for we found its skull. We
saw some half-wild cattle near by. It was a grey evening, and, as
always when out of the river valleys, the scene around was colourless
basaltic desolation.</p>

<img src="images/i_245.jpg" width="510" height="365" alt="" />
<p class="caption">LA GAVIOTA</p>
</div>

<p>On the 9th we struck three habitations. Strong squalls with
gusts of rain accompanied us on our way. Sheep and cattle could
be seen in the valley below, and at last we stopped at an <i>estancia</i>,
where we bought fariña, flour, biscuit, sugar, and mutton&mdash;luxuries
to which we had for some time been strangers. The owner allowed
us to sleep in some mud-houses by the river, and we enjoyed the
shelter, partial as it was.</p>

<p>Our next day's march took us across four fords, and by evening
we reached an <i>estancia</i>, where I was kindly received and given
afternoon tea. <i>Estancia</i> is a word with a fine sound. It may,
however, mean anything from a real house, full of comfort, to a
mud hut. This <i>estancia</i> was a delightful change to us; we could
sit on chairs and saw prints on the wall and a sideboard once more.
The night fell very cold, with an empty heaven overhead, but its
lower arcs set with slate-blue cloud.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span></p>

<p>On the 11th we hit civilisation after a march of over forty miles,
the last part of which lay across a <i>travesia</i>. Civilisation took the
form of an undersized drinking-shop perched on the rim of the
bare pampa. How we had longed for civilisation&mdash;and now we
had found it! I sat writing in a room with pink fly-blown walls
and green fittings of the grimiest. Four Gauchos of the lower
sort were playing cards for beans and shrieking over their game.
The little innkeeper, a small, dark, aquiline, black-bearded Argentine,
in a dirty white vest and a black neck-rag, held rule
inside. Any camp is better than these antennæ of civilisation,
that seem to have touched and always to bear onwards with them
things unclean and repulsive. Jones' homely face was good to
see, when he came in and said, "I should like to be away from
here."</p>

<p class="caption">SANTA CRUZ</p>
</div>

<p>I realised suddenly how I loved the camp and the cold clean
hills, when I heard the raucous music of that unlovely place. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
was scarcely a pleasure to see cognac advertisements again, and to
smell the dregs of yesterday yet awash on the greasy grey metal
counter! A concertina was playing the old aching tunes that
always seem to carry with them tags of vice and crime.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_247" id="i_247"></a>
<img src="images/i_247.jpg" width="550" height="414" alt="" />
<p class="caption">RESIDENTS OF SANTA CRUZ</p>
</div>

<p>We pushed on for Santa Cruz, and on the way passed the
house of another trader, who also sold liquor. It squatted beside
the river, which here flowed blue and estuary-like between white-faced
cliffs backed by bald hills. A board over the door of
the shop bore the legend "<i>La Gaviota</i>," or Seagull. It was
evidently part of the wreckage of some boat washed up on these
beaches.</p>

<p>Santa Cruz town is situated on the banks of a large estuary
formed by the junction of the rivers Santa Cruz and the Southern
Chico before they fall into the Atlantic. It is a straggling place, a
collection of wooden houses with roofs of corrugated iron. The chief
export is wool, which in the season lies in long rows of bales upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
the shore ready to be embarked. The town lies beyond sandhills,
which separate it from the sea. Concertinas and jack-boots ring in
its galvanised-iron huts; mules, horses, dogs, and cattle house
in its formless <i>plazas</i>. It is a place which you hate and like at
one and the same time. You long to get away from it while
you are there, yet find yourself looking back sometimes and
wishing to see again its vague streets and its drag-net agglomeration
of humanity.

</p>

<p>I spent a few days in Santa Cruz making arrangements to
divide my expedition into two parts, leaving Scrivenor with the
<i>peones</i> to collect fossils and specimens in the neighbourhood of the
River Santa Cruz, where most interesting deposits exist, while I
with Burbury and a <i>peon</i>, whom I picked up at Santa Cruz,
recrossed the continent to the lake-region.</p>

<p>In a huge country like Patagonia, to explore and to collect at the
same time is practically out of the question, but by dividing our
forces I hoped to achieve both ends more satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The lake which I now wished to visit is the last very large
piece of water in the long chain of Andean lakes and lagoons. It
is a little to the south of 50° S. lat. From this lake, Lake Argentino,
the River Santa Cruz flows eastwards and empties itself into
the Atlantic, the settlement of Santa Cruz being situated at the
mouth of the river. It was by following the course of this river
upwards for some 140 miles that Darwin made his only serious
expedition into the interior of Patagonia. His party found the
passage of the river both dangerous and laborious, and Captain
FitzRoy decided to return to Santa Cruz on the fifth day, after
they sighted the snowy summits of the Cordillera. Thus they
never reached Lake Argentino.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>We also followed the course of the river, but on horseback
instead of by boat, and thus for the early part of our journey we
passed through the identical country traversed by Darwin.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_250" id="i_250"></a>
<img src="images/i_250.jpg" width="550" height="361" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE MAIN STREET, SANTA CRUZ</p>
</div>

<p>I desired above all things to be able to move rapidly, and
accordingly cut down the amount and weight of our baggage as far
as prudence permitted. I append a list of the provisions, which I
intended&mdash;with the help of guanaco meat&mdash;to last us for the four
months which remained before we must return to the coast if we
wished to escape the severities of the Andean winter:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">35 kilos fariña.</p>
<p class="o1">25 kilos oatmeal.</p>
<p class="o1">15 kilos sugar.</p>
<p>6 lb. tea.</p>
<p class="o1">12 tins cocoa.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Besides these we took a spare change of underclothing, one of
the tents, fifty rounds of 12-bore ball and the same quantity of
shot cartridges and 150 for the Mauser rifle.</p>

<p>We were able to put everything on two <i>cargueros</i>, and even
then they were not very heavily loaded. I took two <i>madrinas</i>,
the Zaino mare and Mrs. Trelew, with their respective troops, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
horses numbering in all twenty-one. During their rest in Santa
Cruz they had attained to quite fair condition, and were in consequence
ready for the road. It was necessary to shoe such as would
permit the operation, as their hoofs had been worn down by the
basalt fragments which had strewed our path from the north.
The operation, by the way, was one which we had to perform
ourselves, as the blacksmith at Santa Cruz, on being asked to do
it, said he preferred the trade of building wooden houses, but consented
to lend us his forge and tools for three dollars a day. We
had some difficulty in finding shoes to fit, and I warn any future
traveller against the nails which they keep for shoeing purposes in
the settlement.</p>

<p>The short harsh grass usually to be had on the pampa is
certainly a very much better food for horses destined to travel
long and hard journeys than the beautiful meadowy <i>vegas</i> of the
Cordillera, which look so inviting. The richer grass of the latter
naturally fattens them in a wonderfully short space of time, but
the first hard day's march cuts up their condition like so much
butter.</p>

<p>We left Santa Cruz on January 22. I was accompanied by
Burbury and a Swede, Bernardo Hähansen, who proved in the
event to be a useful and courageous fellow. Our first march took
us to Mr. Campbell's <i>estancia</i>. We saw a good number of
guanaco and some ostriches on the way, which at first lay across
the open pampa, afterwards diving into a deep <i>cañadon</i> some seven
and a half leagues long. The little Blanco showed his appreciation
of the excellent food he had been enjoying by behaving
badly. On arrival we found Mr. Campbell was away from the farm
repairing fences, so we were obliged to await his return. When
he came, he took us up to the house, where we had some tea. We
remained at the <i>estancia</i> for the night, and next day went on about
three leagues over good pampa to Messrs. Cressard and Dobree's.
The manager, Mr. John Noble, received us kindly. The cook at
this farm, a former New Zealand hand, had come with us to
Puerto Madryn in the <i>Primero de Mayo</i>, and said he would have
applied to go with us had he known how to cargo horses. As he
cooked very well I should have been glad to have received his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
application. On January 24 we reached Clementi's <i>estancia</i>. We
were accompanied on the march by an old Irish sailor with a
Hibernian cast of countenance. The <i>señora</i> asked us into the
house and at once gave us hot milk and bread, which was very
grateful after a long day in the saddle. The valley near by was
full of sheep, and several healthy-looking children were playing
about the buildings. Here also I saw the first and only negro I
met with in Patagonia. The sight of his face gave me a sudden
vivid recollection of Hayti. A long-bearded Argentine patriarch,
whom I descried first in the half-lights of the kitchen during the
evening, looked a very Abraham and most venerable, but daylight
on the morrow robbed him of all romance.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_252" id="i_252"></a>
<img src="images/i_252.jpg" width="550" height="324" alt="" />
<p class="caption">FORD ON THE RIVER SANTA CRUZ</p>
</div>

<p>On this day (the 25th) we pushed on to the Sub-prefecto's
<i>estancia</i>. It consisted of the usual corrugated iron shanty and
barn. We marched on the following morning and reached La
Ultima Casa, where we were hospitably entertained by Mrs.
Hardy. She was indeed very kind. Her husband had been an
Englishman, but she herself was an Argentine. It is certainly a
fact in Patagonia that the Argentines are far more ready to show
hospitality than are our own countrymen. One hardly wonders,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
however, at people being a little cautious and suspicious, as the
wayfarer is not always a wandering angel in Patagonia, or, for that
matter, in any thinly populated country that is being newly opened
up. Therefore we were the more grateful to our hostess of La
Ultima Casa. At the shanty of another farmer, a Scotchman, we
had had the door bolted against us, and been told to await his
home-coming if we wished to enter the house.</p>

<p>We ate our meal at Mrs. Hardy's sitting on up-turned boxes,
and she brought out some magazines for our reading. Hers was a
strange existence, poor old lady! She appeared to be regarded or&mdash;it
comes to the same thing&mdash;thought she was regarded a little in
the light of an Ishmaelite by her neighbours, who were trying (she
told me) to acquire her land. Her position did not seem to be
prosperous. The <i>casa</i> had the usual corrugated roof, and her one
window could boast no glass. From this main building a sort of
barn jutted out to the left. Later on, I decided that this annex,
which I at first took to be a barn, must be the old lady's private
sanctum, for from it she produced five magazines, some lions'
claws, a skunk-skin rug, some hen's eggs, and the hen herself. A
regular widow's cruse of a place. The blackened roof of the
kitchen was supported by four beams lengthways and four across,
these last shiny as if tarred with the smoke of many winters. An
old step-ladder in the corner answered the uses of a cupboard,
cups and so forth being kept on a couple of wooden shelves, and
lumps of sheep's fat decorated the room. We sat on the old
wooden bedstead with its pile of sheepskins for bed-clothes and
wrote our diary. Our hostess, who wore her hair in two plaits
hanging down at each side of her face, sat on a case and talked
while she drank the inevitable <i>maté</i> through a <i>bombilla</i>. She
asked us to remain over a second day, which was most good of
her, but we had to continue our journey.</p>

<p>We marched until about three o'clock, when, coming up to an
empty shanty, we took shelter in it for a while, as it happened to
be very hot. Later we started again, and made a long march
across a pampa above the <i>cañadon</i> of the Santa Cruz, which is
here two miles or more in breadth. Speaking of this <i>cañadon</i>, I
cannot do better than give Darwin's words: "This valley varies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
from five to ten miles in breadth: it is bounded by step-formed
terraces, which rise in most parts one above the other to the
height of 500 feet, and have on the opposite sides a remarkable
correspondence."</p>

<p>The river winds considerably as it flows through the <i>cañadon</i>,
the sides of which are very bare and grassless, excepting where
springs break through and flow down the cliff-side, their course
being marked by a line of vivid green. The pampa above, along
which we travelled, was made up of bare yellow levels, broken
here and there by strips and patches of a very dark green bush, so
dark as to seem almost black. We found a good deal of difficulty
in getting to a camp with water, as the pampa was very dry, so we
prolonged our march till 7.15 <span class="s08">P.M.</span>, when we came upon a shallow
and turbid stream running down in a southerly direction from the
<i>barranca</i>. In the end we had to descend into the <i>cañadon</i> of the
river. Not far from the spot which we chose for camping lay the
bodies of some eighty guanaco with their skins on, which had died
during the previous winter.</p>

<p>The landscape immediately on the banks of the Santa Cruz is
arid and hopeless in the extreme, but one can never forget the
glory of Patagonia, its wonderful sunsets, which gleam out over
the dull-hued empty wastes in a splendour of colour. So on that
night as I stood in the shadow that steeped all my side of the
river, the other bank was lit up with a translucent glow of sunset
as delicately yellow as if it shone through the petals of a buttercup.</p>

<p>On January 27 we started along the <i>cañadon</i>, which continued
to be desolate and rather stony. We saw many guanaco, living
and dead. After a time we made for the pampa above, from
where we looked once again upon the Cordillera, gleaming very
dim and faint on the horizon. Finding a lagoon with some grass
about it, we off-saddled for an hour. Later we marched on rather
more slowly than usual, and camped in such a place as a wildfowler
might see in dreams of the night. A lagoon of sword-blue water,
but in shape like an arrowhead, rimmed in with low green rushes,
above these yellow tussocks of coarse grass bending in the wind,
behind all a bare promontory arched over by a sad evening sky.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
On the breeze came the "Honk, honk" of geese mixed with
the thinner notes of snipe. Ducks, too, were there, and the snipe
in wisps of thirty. Presently, as I sat writing, a guanaco came in
sight, and later a flock of cayenne lapwings (<i>Vanellus cayennensis</i>).
I might have been, as far as the aspect of things was concerned
(save for the guanaco) in Uist and going home to a warm fireside,
instead of journeying on and on for many days and weeks to come
over the endless pampa and into the distant Cordillera.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_255" id="i_255"></a>
<img src="images/i_255.jpg" width="550" height="375" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The Drinking-place.</p>
</div>

<p>At this lagoon also I saw a condor (<i>Sarcorhampus gryphus</i>),
and before this had seen a couple when at Mrs. Hardy's. It must
have been near this spot that Darwin shot his condor, which he
speaks of as measuring eight and a half feet from wing-tip to wing-tip,
and four feet from head to tail.</p>

<p>By the middle of the next day (January 28) we reached a
lagoon with a threshold of green meadowy marsh, a relief after a
long pull over a waterless and bare stretch of country, and there
took a needed half-hour of rest. On our second starting we
managed to wander into a desert of basalt or lava, and could only
advance very slowly and with difficulty.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Nor could we find water
for a long time; at length we came in sight of a big pool
lying ruffled in the saffron lights of the sunset. Upon its margin
or in the water were flamingos (<i>Phoenicopterus ignipalliatus</i>),
upland geese (<i>Chloephaga magellanica</i>), thirty-four bandurias
(<i>Theristicus caudatus</i>). There were also guanaco within sight.
Here we camped, and found yet another deep and rocky lagoon,
on which were many divers which I could not identify. A heavy
wind was blowing, which died down at night and gave occasion
for hundreds of sandflies to rise and worry us. Each day, as we
marched on, the Cordillera seemed to be advancing, as it were,
towards us.</p>

<p>We woke to find the next day pale with thin sunlight glinting
across the prospect of basalt, low bushes and far horizons. We
were now well beyond Mystery Plain, which formed the limit of
Darwin's expeditions up the river, and which he named with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
strong desire to push on and find out what lay on its farther
side.</p>

<p>On the 29th we made a long march. After some couple
of hours' going we saw ahead of us clear pampa instead of the
rocky stone-strewn surface of the region we had been passing
through of late. Over this pampa, though it was tussocky and
uneven, we were able to advance at a good rate towards a line of
hills that rose in the west. As we approached we saw that they
stood up ridge behind ridge, and over these we rode, passing
many good camping-grounds and seeing herds of guanaco, but no
wood or bush for fire. At last we got to the top of the last ridge
of all, and there, standing in the teeth of a strong wind, we looked
down upon Lake Argentino lying below us, and backed by the
peaks and snow summits of the Cordillera.</p>

<p>Although there were many <i>cañadones</i> and grass of the richest,
we could find no water, and so went on and on.</p>

<p>Presently, as we were descending towards the lake, we reached
a lagoon, but found no feed there for the horses, so we were forced
to leave it behind, although the troop was tired and we had been
for several hours in the saddle. I perceived traces of horses at
some distance, and we therefore left the bank of the lagoon and
cut across the pampa heading for them. We wandered on
through bare hills, which fell in perplexing folds, curve within
curve, and at last we reached the River del Bote, which has but
one ford by which we could cross. This we found, worked the
troop over, and then encamped.</p>

</div>

<p>Day by day we had been leaving behind us the seemingly
limitless pampas and were now drawing close to the full blue
range of minaret-shaped mountains. Each march was adding to
their height and making clearer the details hidden in the hedge-sparrow-egg
hue of their distances. First we came in sight of
Mount Viscachas one morning when, bearing a little too far out
upon the pampa, we struck a tract of very bad going. The ground
was covered with thorny bushes and basalt fragments, and here
and there harsh tussocks of grass sprouted from the blackened
wilderness of stones. The night we passed beside the lagoon on
the high pampa left an impression on my mind as one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
most desolate and forbidding of camps. Flocks of flamingos were
standing in the upland pool, and round about upon the little promontories
that thrust out into the wind-whipped water bandurias
were huddled in close order, while as the evening began to fall a
wisp of snipe flew over, wailing most mournfully. Few things,
indeed, seem to me to bring out into keener prominence the
loneliness of a place than the cry of snipe heard in the windy
gloaming. There is some suggestion of human sorrow in the
sound.</p>

<p>So we had journeyed westward, having always upon the south
the yellow pampa, and beside us on the north the river running
through its deep <i>cañadon</i>, while every dawn the vast phalanx of
the Andean peaks seemed to have moved nearer, as though the
great mass of mountain was marching slowly and surely towards
us like the battle-front of some destroying army.</p>

<p>Again we came upon a second death-place of guanaco, which
made a scene strange and striking enough. There cannot have
been less than five hundred lying there in positions as forced and
ungainly as the most ill-taken snapshot photograph could produce.
Their long necks were outstretched, the rime of weather upon their
decaying hides, and their bone-joints glistening through the wounds
made by the beaks of carrion-birds. They had died during the
severities of the previous winter, and lay literally piled one upon
another. A brown, almost chocolate-coloured, lagoon washed
close to the front rank of the dead, and those in the rearmost line
had evidently lain down to die while in the very act of descending
the tall <i>barranca</i> for water. The mortality among guanaco in a
really hard winter is tremendous. They die in batches, absolutely
in hundreds. At that season they come down to the lower
grounds for warmth and water, but desert them in the summer
and take to the high pampa, where, as I have described in another
place, the Indians hunt and slay them in great numbers for their
pelts. The cry of the guanaco is a noise unique. It is something
between a bleat, a laugh, and a neigh. Often the old <i>macho</i> of a
herd would come to the high ground nearest to our camp, and from
it neigh defiance at us, while the rest of the point would satisfy
their curiosity by staring from a safer distance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>Upon the high pampa, across which, bearing north-west, we
passed, we found guanaco to be extraordinarily plentiful, and
fatter than any we had hitherto met with in our wanderings
through the country. Upon this pampa was no firewood at all,
nothing save rolling grass which pricked you with minute thorns,
so that a walk through it left your putties spined like a porcupine.
To stalk in this grass, where the guanacos were unusually wild, and
long periods of crawling were necessary to attain success, one had
to carry a piece of guanaco-skin in the left hand, which took up
the grass spines that must otherwise have entered the palm of the
hunter.</p>

<p>Our first glimpse of Lake Argentino was a strongly-marked
and vivid picture as seen from the rim of the high pampa when
we surmounted it. A great eye of blue water&mdash;for the sun was
bright&mdash;set beneath white pent-house brows of the mountain range.
A tremendous wind was blowing out of the north-west, and we
could see the great southern lake was in a turmoil of short and
angry seas. Deep channels cut away into the depths of the Cordillera
at the western end, and at the eastern side the waters flowed
out into the swift current of the River Santa Cruz. Farther along
the northern shore the <i>cañadon</i> of the River Leona was also visible.
We could not then guess how glad we should one day be to reach
the haven of that river mouth. Beyond the lake, and partly surrounding
it, the Cordillera raised their jagged line of peaks against
the sky. From the bases upwards towards the higher altitudes
the mountains were black with forests. Three large icebergs
floated on the water at the farther side, one of which had drifted
into shallows near the shore. No sign of life was to be observed
anywhere in the great hollow stretching beneath us.</p>

<p>To my mind Argentino is a far more beautiful lake than Buenos
Aires. After a long look we began to descend into the lower land
by a sharp cleft that led down into a deep <i>cañadon</i>. It was, owing
to a recent landslip, a nasty piece of travelling, and the horses,
disliking it, broke back more than once, the <i>Zaino overo</i> taking the
lead as usual.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_263" id="i_263"></a>
<img src="images/i_263.jpg" width="550" height="382" alt="" />
<p class="caption">FIORD OF LAKE ARGENTINO, SHOWING FOREST ON MOUNT AVELLANEDA</p>
</div>

<p>Emerging from this cleft we came on one of Nature's tragedies.
Upon the side of the slope was a guanaco, fallen (when I first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
caught sight of it) upon its knees, and making frantic efforts to
rise. Three huge condors were poised a few feet above the head
of the unfortunate animal. I galloped towards them, and as I came
near the guanaco fell over upon its side, still moving convulsively.
At once one of the condors lit on the ground beside it. I cannot
have been more than a minute approaching, and as I came close
the condor rose into the air to some distance. A thin stream of
blood was trickling down the surface of the rock upon which the
guanaco lay, and the poor creature was jerking its legs and body.
During the moment which I had taken to ride up the condor
had torn out its eyes! The guanaco was evidently dying of scab,
and had thinned down into a mere skeleton.</p>

<p>I own to a horror and a loathing of the condor. Seen against
the pale hue of the sky, its stately flight and grand spread of
motionless wing made it seem a noble bird, but near by it shared
the repulsive appearance of other carrion-eaters. In size it is
enormous. I shot one off Hellgate measuring nine feet three inches
across the outstretched pinions. It rivals the vulture in its ability
to quickly discover and arrive upon the scene of a feast, and is in
the habit of gorging itself until it becomes practically powerless,
and it is possible to slay it afoot with a stick. It is one thing to be
well mounted on a good horse and to watch, as you ride along, the
far specks in the intense blue, or to admire them wheeling in wide
graceful circles with quiescent wings, but quite another aspect of
them would be borne in upon you if your horse chanced to stumble,
and left you, say, with a broken leg upon the empty pampa; long
before help might come, or, indeed, if you were alone, would be at
all likely to come, you would make a terribly close acquaintance
with the methods a condor adopts when meat&mdash;be it dead or
wounded&mdash;falls under his power of beak and claw.</p>

<p>Patagonia is certainly a wonderful country for birds and beasts
of prey. You may travel leagues upon leagues and see no sign
of life save chimangos (<i>Milvago chimango</i>), caranchos (<i>Polyborus
thaurus</i>), and condors (<i>Sarcorhampus gryphus</i>) in the air and
upon the bushes, and at your feet the tracks of lion and of fox
and of skunk. Sometimes this fact strikes you with peculiar
force. The landscape made up of thorny bushes and spike grass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
jagged rocks, and white and grey slime, in which live the puma,
the wild-cat, and the fox; the air inhabited by birds of prey.
What do they live upon, these creatures, there are so many of
them? How do they eke out existence? Sparse herds of guanaco
(I am now alluding to the sterile portions of the country, such as
lie about the north shore of Lake Buenos Aires and also part of the
north shore of Lake Argentino), a few small birds, and abundant
rodent life of the smaller species&mdash;that is all. Curiously enough,
in the richer lands of Patagonia, it seemed to me that, though
there was more game, there were fewer birds and beasts of prey.</p>

<p>In the winter and in the spring the country, as far as wild life
is concerned, is but a thin and gaunt place. Nothing that wanders
carries any fat, for the food has been reduced to a minimum. It
is on this sterile battlefield of nature that living creatures enter
into a death-grapple with the conditions of life, and swing to and
fro in a contest whose outcome is only decided when the dark days
of storm are over; for at this season the richer lands are often
under snow, and it is about the bare margins of lakes and lagoons
that the game gathers and remains.</p>

<p>All the way up the River Santa Cruz we were able to recognise
the points marked and named by Darwin, until finally his party
was forced through lack of provisions to turn back just when he
had arrived within reasonable distance of the great lake. He
named this last prospect he looked out over in Patagonia,
"Mystery Plain." Now it no longer is mysterious, but Darwin's
map remains to this day the best chart made of the river.</p>

<p>His description and his opinion of the country are sufficiently
dismal, but he passed through a waste and empty land, before
colonising on the coasts had reached its present state, or much of
the country within reach of the sea had been partitioned, as it now
is, into sheep farms. And it must be admitted that the neighbourhood
of the Santa Cruz is somewhat sterile, and would be likely
to give a false idea of Patagonia as a forbidding land to a stranger
who knew no more of the country than the coast and this boulder
and sand-strewn river valley. This <i>cañadon</i> is, in fact, covered
with glacial detritus.</p>

</div>

<p>Leaving the shore of the lake well to our right we rode parallel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
with it for some miles, crossed the Rivers Calafate and de los
Perros, and finally arrived upon a peninsula which culminates in
Mount Buenos Aires. This peninsula is called the Burmeister
Peninsula. Here, many days' ride into the interior, and under the
very shadow of the Andes,
lives an English pioneer, Mr.
Cattle, whom we visited, and
who was kind enough to help
me in every way and to give
us hospitality.</p>

<p>During the first night we
spent upon the shores of Lake
Argentino there was a heavy
snowfall on the tops of the
nearer mountains.</p>

<div class="figright"><a name="i_269" id="i_269"></a>
<img src="images/i_269.jpg" width="357" height="239" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>ESTANCIA</i> OF MR. E. CATTLE</p>
</div>

<p>Our first move was in the direction of Lake Rica&mdash;so-called
locally. Upon the maps we had with us it was marked
as a separate lake connected by a river with Lake Argentino.
We soon proved this to be a mistake, the so-called Lake Rica
being an arm of the large lake, connected with the parent volume
of water by a channel of considerable width, which is occasionally
blocked, or nearly so, by icebergs. I should mention that we had
left England before the publication of Dr. Moreno's excellent
map, in which this and many other errors had already been set
right.</p>

<p>Taking our horses, we made our way to the south-west along
the shores of Lake Rica. We were forced to make détours, as
the steep banks were cut up by innumerable rifts, at the bottom of
nearly every one of which streams of varying size emptied themselves
into the fjord. Heavy forests clothed the slopes of the hills
almost to the margin of the water. Very little animal life was to
be observed. I picked up a number of iron-ore stalactites on the
shores and also from the mud of the shallow water near them.
When approaching the end of this South Fjord&mdash;as Lake Rica
should properly be called&mdash;of Lake Argentino we crossed a river
or rather, I should say, a torrent, that after a riotous course between
very steep cliffs flowed over a rocky bed into the South Fjord.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
This river would have been, I should say, impassable at an earlier
date in the season.</p>

<p>Our advance was finally stopped by cliffs which descended
clear to the water's edge. We camped on the shingle at the foot
of the cliffs just short of the spot where their bases plunged under
the level of the water, and all night long we could hear the rushing
thunder of masses of ice breaking from the parent glaciers and
crashing down into the fjord.</p>

<p>The weather now completely broke up. Rain fell in, close
steady lines all across our outlook over the western fjord, and the
drenched forests behind us tossed and creaked in the wind.
Nothing more dismal and depressing can be imagined than this
forest-land dim with lowering skies and a downpour of rain.
For four days the heavy rain, sometimes mixed with sleet,
continued to fall, and through it we rode back to the Burmeister
Peninsula.</p>

<p>It was upon the shores of Lake Argentino that a great Gaucho,
perhaps I should say the greatest of all Gauchos, one Ascensio
Brunel, at one time found a hiding-place. We visited the spot
later on, but here I may as well tell some part of the story of his
life. He was very generally known for many years as the "Wild
Man of Santa Cruz," and his history was an extraordinary one&mdash;one
of those smears of high and vivid colour which circumstance
occasionally paints in upon the dull humdrum picture of the daily
life of a district.</p>

<p>Let us set out his antecedents.</p>

<p>He and his brother were Gauchos. They lived in camp, and
were partners in a small business. Cattle, sheep, and horses
formed their stock.</p>

<p>Once they went together on a long journey, and became
acquainted with a lady, whom we will call Bathsheba. They both
loved her; yet she was another's.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_271" id="i_271"></a>
<img src="images/i_271.jpg" width="550" height="396" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The Wild Man.</p>
</div>

<p>The two brothers descended upon that other and slew him.
Then they made off with the lady to the wilder districts. There
they quarrelled about her. Ascensio waited until his brother happened
to be away tracking horses in a particularly wild part, and
then he rounded up the remainder of the stock, and he and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
lady fled yet deeper into the interior. For a space they covered
their tracks and escaped the brother.</p>

<p>In the course of time the lady left her lover, as ladies will, and
he, his brain turned by some strange passion, went mad.</p>

<p>When we strike his trail again he was known as the "Wild
Man of Santa Cruz."</p>

<p>He began to steal horses, found the sport to his liking, and
stole more. Unable to use or keep them, he merely drove them
to some sleepy hollow, where he killed them in hundreds. (We
once counted eighty-three of these skeletons in one place.) He
dressed in the skins of pumas from head to foot. His saddle was
of puma-skin, and armed only with <i>boleadores</i> he ranged the land
stealing. His career was a long one, and he became such a Gaucho
as has never been known. To-day he might be heard of as lifting
a dozen horses on the Santa Cruz River; a week later he was
spiriting away <i>tropillas</i> in Chubut.</p>

<p>He had the run of 300,000 square miles, the whole of Patagonia
was his farm, his stock what he could steal.</p>

<p>You may remember that I described a meeting with Indians,
a tribe who lived in tents of guanaco-skins on the River Mayo.
The Wild Man paid them a visit, and stole a hundred mares; and
they, discovering it, rode down his trail and caught him. They
took him alive and haled him as a prisoner to the nearest settlement,
where he was put in gaol.</p>

<p>He escaped, made straight back, and lifted another big batch
of the Mayo Indians' horses.</p>

<p>Again they pursued him, but he was fain to escape, being
mounted on a very good horse. At last, only one Indian continued
to hold on his trail, and he, when he neared the wild figure clad in
puma-skins, grew afraid and turned back.</p>

<p>The Wild Man rode on, and also out of our story and all human
ken. That was four years ago. He has not been heard of since.
But I daresay that the Mayo Indians could finish off the story
with a different ending.

</p>

<p>As it was impossible to make any further exploration without a
craft of some sort, I began to cast about for materials for boat-building
or, rather, for boat-repairing. There were a couple of
canvas boats on the spot, left on the shore by a Commission some
three years previously, with which I thought perhaps something
might be done. But these, on examination, proved to be so worn
with the stress of weather, and when launched shipped so much
water, that it seemed hardly practicable to use them for our purpose,
the more especially as their holding capacity made it impossible to
take more than a small quantity of provisions.</p>

<p>I next heard of a boat on the River Santa Cruz, but that was
also in very evil plight, added to which the odds were against our
being able to get her up to Lake Argentino, owing to the fact that
the River Santa Cruz was in flood and the current more than
usually fierce.</p>

<p class="ch_summ"><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The author regrets the comparative absence of illustration to this chapter.
The launch shipped so much water through her broken plate and in other ways that
the photographs taken were destroyed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>I have mentioned in an earlier chapter the boat which Dr.
Moreno had during his last expedition in the year 1897 brought,
at much cost and labour, to Lake Viedma. There lay our
hope. It was a steam-launch, and the Argentine Commission had
packed her up carefully and snugly on the shore; but, although
we knew nothing of her present condition, we were aware that the
chances against her remaining undisturbed for that period of time
were small, as Lake Viedma is not difficult of access, and in all
probability wandering bands of Indians or Gauchos had got at the
boat, stripped off her covering of canvas, and looted such of her
contents as seemed to possess any value in their eyes.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_275" id="i_275"></a>
<img src="images/i_275.jpg" width="550" height="403" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE LAUNCH<br />
	WITH MR. CATTLE AND BERNARDO ON BOARD</p>
</div>

<p>However that might be, this launch appeared to be our only
resource, and I was lucky indeed to have been given leave to use
her if necessary. On my speaking to Cattle on the matter, he was
kind enough to offer to accompany me. Burbury possessed a
good knowledge of engineering, which would be of invaluable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
service to us, and, as it happened, Bernardo, in the course of his
adventurous career, had had some experience in the engine-room
of a Brazilian steamer.</p>

<p>So on February 15 we set out for Lake Viedma, with the idea
of bringing the launch, if possible, down the River Leona, which
is the connecting waterway between the Lakes Viedma and
Argentino.</p>

<p>To travel from our starting point at the foot of Mount Buenos
Aires to Lake Viedma it was necessary to skirt Lake Argentino
until the southern outlet of the Leona was reached, and then to
follow that river to its source in Lake Viedma. The distance was
about eighty miles more or less, and included the fording of the
River Santa Cruz.</p>

<p>Our party was made up of four men and twenty-one horses,
and upon one of the packs we took a light canvas collapsible boat
and a pair of oars with which to negotiate the Santa Cruz.</p>

<p>On the following evening we arrived on its southern bank.
There we found an old Commission boat that was used as a ferry, but
it was beached, with the usual contrariety of things, on the wrong
side of the stream, which is from one hundred and fifty to two
hundred yards wide at this spot and runs with a swift current.
Many a Gaucho has lost his life in attempting to cross lower down.</p>

<p>Next morning it was still dark when the plume of smoke rose
from our camp-fire of califate-wood, and as we sat round it waiting
for the <i>asado</i> to cook, we smoked (a bad habit when indulged in
before breakfast, against which one would warn everybody else)
and drank <i>maté</i>. It was a cool dawn I remember that developed
later into a hot day. We put the collapsible boat together, and
Cattle, after a mishap with a rowlock, brought the old and leaky
ford-boat across, as we needed her to transport our baggage. We
piled the cargo into her, and such weak places as we could deal
with we strengthened.</p>

<p>The theory was to take the filly through the river behind the
boat, trusting that the old black bell-mare would follow her offspring,
and the troop in its turn follow the mare, as had occurred
on the occasion of our former crossing of the river near the settlement
of Santa Cruz.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>So we dragged the reluctant and much-protesting filly down to
the riverside, conveyed the boat a few hundred yards up-stream,
and then Bernardo and I got aboard and shoved off. I had put a
collar round the filly's neck, and by this supported her in the wake
of the boat. All would have gone well had not one of the rowlocks,
worn by weather and worm-eaten, struck work and smashed.
Left with but one oar the current took charge of us. Soon the
unfortunate filly began to turn over in the water like a catherine-wheel,
and I was unable to help her much, as I was holding
a rowlock in place with one hand and supporting the filly with
the other. Eventually we were obliged to put back, and were
lucky enough to make the south bank just in time, for at that part
of the shore there is but a small stretch upon which it is
possible to land; immediately below high cliffs descend sheer to
the water.</p>

<p>After this we resolved to drive the troop over before us, but
although they had had a long-journey experience of river-crossing
they did not care to face the Santa Cruz. In spite of our efforts
they broke back five or six times. Once we nearly had them in
the water, when the little Zaino got away and galloped up the
bank. At last, however, by dint of bellowing and brandishing oars
or anything that came handy, we succeeded in convincing them
that the south shore of the Santa Cruz had become unhealthy
to remain upon, and so they swam over. We started at once
with a boatful of gear, and landed barely in time to defeat the
ambitious intentions of the leading spirits of the troop, who on
getting out of the water decided to make off and regain a life of
freedom.</p>

<p>As soon as we got the baggage over we saddled-up and rode
through a very sandy tract of land, and by evening made our
camp under a bare hillside by the River Leona.</p>

<p>I believe that a German expedition had once encamped there.
Both wheat and beans were growing near the long-deserted camp-fire.
No doubt the seed had fallen from some of the provision-bags
of the Germans. There was also a miniature <i>corral</i> formed
of bushes.</p>

<p>On the next day we made a very long and tiresome march,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
which led us into more than one difficult place. We rode on
league after league over the worst sort of ground, including the
descent of two or three really bad <i>barrancas</i>. Bernardo, who
acted as guide, became shy after awhile of telling us that Lake
Viedma lay only two leagues ahead. As the day wore on we
rather pressed the question, and he grew correspondingly coy in
his replies.</p>

<p>One of the <i>barrancas</i> led us into a sort of maze of conical mud
hills, confusedly huddled together. Through them lay a tangle of
guanaco-tracks, which mostly ended on the tops of the hills. The
troop followed these tracks in various directions, and you were
surprised at all points by the startled faces of the horses glaring
down at you over unexpected bluffs. The going was very heavy,
and deep holes betrayed the horses' feet. Altogether it was some
time before the troop was put through.</p>

<p>Late in the evening we reached the shores of Lake Viedma,
and found the launch. She was lying behind a bare and very low
promontory. The Commission which had used her three years
previously had packed her up with care in canvas and raised her
on rollers. But I was sorry to find that needless and wanton damage
had been inflicted upon her by some roving passers-by. They had
torn off the canvas covering and appropriated many important
tools, including quite a number that could have been of no possible
use to any save a party meaning to use the launch herself. A few
of these missing details we picked up in the adjacent bushes,
where the irresponsible unknowns had thrown them.</p>

<p>As to the condition of the boat, her three-years sojourn on an
isolated beach had not improved it. Her boiler was in rather a
bad state with rust, and one of her plates was cracked. Originally
built for a pleasure-launch, the Argentine Commission had raised
her gunwales and decked her in; without these alterations she could
not have lived in the rough waters of the lakes of Patagonia.</p>

<p>The evening and the surrounding scenery were equally grey
and depressing, but with an ostrich, and a guanaco I had shot
in the morning, we made ourselves very comfortable round the
fire, while we talked over our contemplated voyage down the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Leona. Cattle, whose knowledge of the subject under consideration
was of immense help, agreed with me in thinking the thing
could be done.</p>

<p>Next day Burbury, who was, as I have said, a very fair engineer,
set to work with Bernardo's help to get the launch into working
order, while the rest of us went to cut and gather fuel.</p>

<p>The two canvas boats which belonged to the launch were later
found a couple of leagues down the shore, but a bit of wind began
to blow, so it was impossible to bring them up, and in the event
they had to be left where they were.</p>

<p>In making ready the launch Burbury was much hampered by
having only a small supply of screws to draw upon. Time and
exposure had dealt hardly with her, her pump was strained as well
as being imperfect, some portion of it having been taken away.
The craft was about thirty-five feet long with a displacement of
about three parts of a ton. She was by no means an ideal boat
for the kind of navigation that lay before us, for which a good
wooden craft would have been much more safe and handy. Had
her length been less it would have been another advantage, as the
seas upon the lakes are very short. Weather-worn as she was,
however, she represented our sole chance of getting really deep
into the unpenetrated Cordillera. It was a case of take it or leave
it, and which of the two it was to be gave me some thought that
night.</p>

<p>I could not conceal from myself that it was a peculiarly risky
affair taking her down the River Leona. The up-stream navigation
of the river had been made by the launch when the Commission
brought her up-stream, towing her through the difficult
places from the bank. But that, of course, was a very different
matter.</p>

<p>The Leona is a comparatively large river, very cold, and running,
when in flood, from five to eight knots an hour, with, in places, a
very strong rip. There are a good many rocks and shoals, but at
the time I write of the water was high, snow-fed by the warmth of
the preceding months, and therefore with luck we might hope to
slip over most of the reefs in safety. This was fortunate, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
what with the cold, the eddies and the cross-currents the chance of
a swimmer reaching the bank was not great.</p>

<p>Should the current, however, get the launch broadside on, we
would have to give her full steam ahead, and charge down the
unknown and rock-set river. Besides, the channel was, we knew,
very hard to follow, for among the islands the stream divided into
four or five arms, and we had no guide to help us to choose the
main channel.</p>

<p>The risks were very real and looked large enough in my eyes
that night, but in case I should be charged with foolhardiness in
deciding to carry out our design, I think I may say that the
average man would have decided as we did. Few, after so
many weary miles and months, coming at last to such a crucial
moment, would very closely consider the risks, since outside of
running them the single course open was to turn back defeated,
leaving one of the most interesting unexplored portions of the
Cordillera unvisited and untrodden.</p>

<p>In the course of the next day or two we worked hard at the
launch and in gathering firewood. On the 18th we got the boat
afloat after eight hours of hard labour, for during her three years
rest she had sunk deep into the shingle and sand. It was quite
impossible to use the horses, as they would not pull forward into
the lake, and thus into the water, so we got at the work ourselves.
About mid-day a wind sprang up, and the water, fed by
the melting snows, was perishingly cold. It seemed for a time as
if we should never succeed in getting her afloat, and as we had not
been able to bring up either of the canvas boats, wading was very
much the order of the day, and after every few stretches of work
we were uncommonly glad to take spells in the sleeping-bags to
warm our half-frozen limbs. Hot cocoa, also, was kept going from
time to time.</p>

<p>At length we got her off into the little shallow bay, where
the waves were breaking, for a wind was rising out of the north-west.</p>

<p class="caption">THE WORLD OF ICE</p>
</div>

<p>During the day Cattle and I went down and viewed the
Leona. We fixed upon a little backwater some distance down
stream, where wood was abundant, as the goal of our first venture.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
The river had swollen and was rising, and the current looked
menacing, but we thought that with great care and slow movement
we might bring the launch through all right. Care and slow movement!
We did not foresee to what an extent the elements were
destined to take charge of our affairs.</p>

<p>Our plan was to descend the river stern-first with only enough
steam to enable the boat to answer her tiller; for fuel we had no
choice but to burn wood, and although califate made no bad firing,
still the results to be expected were not by any means the same as
if we had been able to put coal into the furnace.</p>

<p>In the evening the horses strayed, and I went to bring them
in. The landscape on this side of Viedma is the most desolate
imaginable, being made up chiefly of sand, sparse yellow grass,
low thorn-bushes, and the skeletons of dead game. It is a place
only fit to die in, a fact the guanacos seem to have grasped,
for their bones lay all over the ground in far greater profusion
even than upon the shores of Lake Buenos Aires. The
mountains about Viedma differ in outline from most of the other
ranges in Patagonia. The peaks are more pointed and rise against
the cold sky in a line of pinnacles and minarets.</p>

<p>My way led me along the banks of the Leona. It was a grey
and miserable afternoon verging towards evening, and the strong
wind was sending a large volume of water racing and moaning
between the bare and treeless banks of the river. I remember
thinking with great longing of warm and comfortable England,
of good friends and true, of home, and of all the many small
things which make life worth having. I suppose every one is
attacked with this kind of feeling sometimes. Not very often,
luckily, nor when the sun is shining, but on these miserable, grey,
whimpering evenings everything takes on a sombre shade.</p>

<p>I found the horses collected in a <i>rincon</i>, beneath the shelter
of a few thorn-bushes; they were looking very forlorn, especially
the Alazan, who was etched out darkly against the bleak sky.
They seemed a bit tucked up too after the tiring marches of the
previous days.</p>

<p>We hoped to start in the launch on the following morning.
When we woke it was still blowing half a gale. I, however, told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
Bernardo to get up steam, and we put the baggage aboard, and as
the boat had no name we christened her the <i>Ariel</i>. She was
given other names before we were done with her!</p>

<p>Burbury was to take the horses by the banks of the river, while
we steamed down the channel. It was blowing pretty strong when
all was ready, and Bernardo, to inaugurate the start, raised a feeble
whistle, thereby seriously diminishing the amount of steam in the
boiler. The <i>Ariel</i> got under way with some wheezing and groaning,
and soon we were heaving up and down, head to swell. The
waves were all breaking, and the seas short, with the consequence
that we had several duckings. Presently, however, the wind lulled
and I thought all was about to go well with us.</p>

<p>But soon I noticed that the figure of Burbury, standing upon
the shore, remained ominously stationary. The wind was rising
again, two or three heavy seas broke over us, and the launch
would not answer her tiller. Bernardo shouted that the boiler was
leaking, and it looked as if we should soon be in trouble.</p>

<p>Ultimately we were obliged to put back into the bay, which
we managed with difficulty, and there anchored.</p>

<p>We determined to try again to-morrow, and then got up the
tent and turned in.</p>

<p>On the morrow the wind had dropped somewhat, though the
lake was still white with breakers. We had a <i>maté</i> by the fire on
the promontory and prepared to start again. It was 9.30 when
all was ready, and by that time the Cordillera was shut out by a
big purple rain-cloud. As the rain began to fall we took our
places and heaved in the anchor.</p>

<p>We started at one knot full steam ahead, and the <i>Ariel</i> creaked
as she crept out into the lake. The rain and mist from the
direction of the Cordillera had blotted out all sight of them, and
were beating down on us steadily. The rain, however, was in
reality favourable to our attempt, as it served to smooth the water.
The short waves leaped up under every puff of wind, but the
launch ran along past the mouth of the river, attaining to a quite
respectable speed as she proceeded.</p>

<p>A nasty little squall struck us for a moment as we were broadside
on, but it passed, and then, with her nose pointed toward the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Cordillera, the launch described a large circle, and we allowed her
to be slowly sucked stern first into the power of the fierce current
of the Leona. At length it got hold of her, and, adopting a
cautious policy, we gave her full speed ahead against the current,
which had the effect of letting us drop down stream at about two
knots an hour.</p>

<p>Just before we entered the rip of the current I saw a rock a
couple of feet off on the starboard side; it was only a few inches
under the surface, but luckily we slipped by without harm. We
got on pretty well in this fashion through the whole afternoon; it
was raining pitilessly all the time. Bernardo, who was acting as
engineer, at one period ran the engine at a pressure of 30 lb. above
safety, until it was explained to him that, if he continued doing so,
it was probable he would see Sweden no more.</p>

<p>Towards evening the weather cleared into the most lovely blue
afternoon, and we camped for the night at the spot we had before
chosen, having some fifteen miles of our voyage behind us. We
pitched the tent and I crawled into it and lit a pipe with a vivid
question in my mind as to when I should do so again. You could
hear the river growling and gulping at its banks. I felt I had
never before realised how warm and comfortable that little tent
was. The next day would decide the success of our expedition or
otherwise, and all the worst of the river lay before us. I cannot
deny that I disliked the thought of the morrow. Familiarity with
the River Leona is not apt to breed contempt. Its channel
was made up of sharp bends and curves, and if the launch by
any untoward accident were to swing round, we should be forced
to steam faster than the current, and at that speed she would
certainly split herself from stem to stern if she touched. Besides,
she answered her helm badly, and the river in places was very
narrow.</p>

<p>But, for all this, our success so far had had its effect, and we
resumed our voyage next morning in high spirits. We began by
negotiating a nasty passage among the rocks with neatness. The
river then became very erratic and winding in its course, and
almost at once the current caught us, and it seemed as it some
gigantic hand were pushing the panting launch slowly round.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Steering was no easy matter, she was canted badly, and we
discarded some of our heavy clothes, raw as the air was, preferring
the cold to the chance of sinking should anything happen.</p>

<p>In places the rip was very strong and the curving pearl-grey
water gave but a poor opportunity of observing any rocks that
might lie in our course. We were by this time able to manage
the launch better and were beginning to understand more or less
her special peculiarities.</p>

<p>Then the dreaded event came to pass. We were sagging
down with about 70 lb. of steam in the boiler, when a heavy
squall, which had long been brooding darkly over the Cordillera,
rushed suddenly upon us. The launch, under the fury of the
wind, turned almost broadside on to the current, and it became
necessary to give her her head.</p>

<p>Bernardo, who had had his orders as to what to do in case
such an eventuality occurred, flung open the furnace-door and
piled on wood to get a heavy head of steam on. The <i>Ariel's</i>
powers had much improved with use, and she was able to race
along ahead of the current, a fact which gave her steerage-way.</p>

<p>"She's steering a bit better," shouted Cattle; "if Bernardo can
keep up the pressure it may be all right." Bernardo, evidently
feeling that the moment needed commemoration, blew the whistle
and grinned.</p>

<p>Now that she was turned prow-first, any attempt to get the boat
back to her old position would have been more risky than to go
forward, for the river at this part was much narrower and the current
proportionately more rapid. Bernardo poked his head up from the
engine-hatch and laughed, "She go fine this way," he remarked.
At the moment a rock glimmered up close to the bows, but we
slipped over it with a few inches to spare.</p>

<p>There was now no straining and grunting from the engines as
there had been while we were battling against the current. You
barely felt the throb and vibration, and it was only when you
looked at the banks that you realised how swiftly the boat was
rushing onwards. Perhaps we achieved seventeen knots. The
shores slid by.</p>

<p>We were now shut in in a world of our own, whose boundaries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
were the curving banks and the reaches of the river as they opened
out in front of us. One's senses were too much occupied, one's
nerves too much on the
stretch to be aware of
anything beyond. We,
the launch and the river
were playing a gigantic
gamble, in which the
stakes on our part were
perilously heavy. This
continued to be for five
minutes one's most prominent
idea. It was very
exciting, for we had nothing
to do but await
developments.</p>

<div class="figright"><a name="i_287" id="i_287"></a>
<img src="images/i_287.jpg" width="393" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BERNARDO HÄHANSEN</p>
</div>

<p>Very soon, however,
this feeling wore off. It
seems that a very strong
emotion cannot in the
nature of things last long.
Undoubtedly <i>c'est le premier
pas qui coûte</i>. I
looked round and saw
the other two grinning.</p>

<p>At the pace we were then going our voyage was not likely to
last more than four hours. This was a rough calculation allowing
for the windings of the river that lay between us and Lake
Argentino. We afterwards found that we ran the distance in
three and a half hours, but they passed like a quarter of an hour.
I do not suppose that any suicide club has ever invented a more
acute form of excitement.</p>

<p>We rarely saw half a mile in front of us. At first the
banks were low and the coarse grass upon them blew and shook
against the pale blue of the sky-rim, but soon they began to
give place to high and rocky slopes. Now and then one caught
the glitter of a submerged rock. The wind and the current made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
the main channel difficult to follow with the eye, and round several
corners we were positively feeling for it.</p>

<p>In places it seemed as if the launch were running into an <i>impasse</i>,
and at such times it was necessary to send her along at her highest
pressure in order to have the more command of the tiller. We
would rush down upon such a place, and not until we were within
forty yards would the river open out grey and shining, the helm be
put over, and we find ourselves flying down another reach. We
always kept to the rip, and by so doing attempted to follow the
main channel.</p>

<p>About midway down the river came some more difficult places
where the cliffs narrowed. One of these gave us a curious experience
for the water seemed to absolutely go downhill, so steep was
the angle of incline. Before reaching this spot we had come in
sight of the top of the cliff that overhung it, and whose base, we
could judge by the line of the channel, must be washed by the water.
On turning a corner we came within full view of the place, and a
strange view it was. The river appeared to race downhill and to
end in a froth of yeasty foam at the foot of the towering black
bluff. Look as we might, we could not see any way out of that
tumbled smother of water; we knew there must be one, of course,
but the question was in which direction did it lie. There was
nothing for it but to pile on fuel to make the boat answer
handily.</p>

<p>The sun striking obliquely on the river dazzled our eyes and
turned all our forward course into a golden splendour. We knew
that somewhere lower down the river there was a bad place where
its bed was thick-set with rocks, but we had no idea how soon we
might come upon the spot. Presently, as we drew rapidly nearer
and nearer to the cliff face, it became evident that the channel bent
very sharply to starboard, and that we should have uncommonly
little room to turn in. We were now running in shadow, the high
banks having blotted out the sun. We rushed on towards the cliff,
and almost at the last moment saw that the channel bent away to
the right; Cattle put the helm hard over, and our craft whirled
round the point with small space to spare, and we found ourselves
snaking through the eddies of another reach.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span></p>

<p>We shouted to each other that the worst of it lay behind us,
and such for a time seemed to be the case, the river widening out
to about eighty yards across. Here the main channel was clearly
marked. It might be supposed that we should have taken this
opportunity to turn the launch into her original position, but we
had twice during the morning been in difficulties with the pump,
which, as the injector would not work, was our sole means of filling
the boiler. I was afraid that the strain of steaming against the
current might prove too much for the launch. The decision to go
on without turning her was, I think, under the circumstances, the
right one, the more so as directly after the descent of the river
the pump became further strained, with the result that it was
impossible to refill the boiler save by hand.</p>

<p>Presently the hilly shores once more gave place to low banks,
and islands began to appear in the stream. The lower river has
many of these groups of flat islands covered with stones and
coarse grass. When we got in among them the river broke up
into a dozen channels which all looked alike. We, of course, chose
the largest. Again it branched. Again we chose the largest, and
again.</p>

<p>At length the channel we were following, instead of opening off
into the main river, subdivided into a couple of very small streams.
The current was as strong as ever, and the depth of water
appeared to be about three feet. A small crested grebe was uttering
its peculiar, melancholy cry. Ahead the banks seemed to
draw together to a jutting corner, beyond which we could not see.
Cattle was at the helm, I was standing up on the fore-hatch trying
to catch sight of what we were coming to.</p>

<p>All this time we could not slacken speed, for the current tore
along and we outdid the current. The water had the same strange
appearance of running downhill; it seemed to drop away from us
at an extraordinary angle. The force of the current forced us to
keep steam up to a high degree of pressure, up to 45 lb., which
was 15 lb. beyond safety.</p>

<p>At this point the stream was not above eighteen feet wide, and
we could almost touch the banks on either side. We were now
about half-way downhill, so to speak. The rush of the water, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
zipp of the wind as it swept past our ears mingled with the cry of
the astonished waterfowl. Nearer and nearer, clear water showed
under the left bank, and in a moment more we had swept round
the corner of rock and out into the main channel of the river once
more. We flew along in the strong rip, the launch shook and
quivered, and we discovered with joy that we had gained the
wide lower reaches.</p>

<p>Our troubles were at an end for the day. A dozen miles
still lay before us, but in fair and open water. In due time we
recognised a big stone which marked the site of our old camp
where we had rested on the way up. We secured the launch
a little way below it, where the Leona enters Lake Argentino.</p>

<p>After landing we pitched the tent and sat down to talk it all
over. In the meantime we cooked and ate an armadillo, which
Burbury had caught on the previous day. It tasted very like
sucking-pig.</p>

<p>Then a curious thing happened. The launch, which was
bumping slightly at her anchorage, had to be moved, and going
on board we found that the pump had again struck work, as it did
on many subsequent occasions. One could not help thinking what
the result might have been if it had broken down a little earlier in
the day. What a wonderful word that little "if" is! Two letters
long, but it may mark the distance from pole to pole, the difference
between life and death.</p>

<p>That night a series of heavy squalls blew out of the west. We
lay in the tent and listened to the wind with the luxurious feeling
that comes of good shelter.

</p>

<p>Late in the evening of the same day Burbury arrived with the
horses, and upon the following morning I rode on with him to pass
the troop over the Santa Cruz River. We took with us one of
Cattle's hounds, and sighting some ostriches on the way we gave
chase. The dog had a rope affixed to his collar, by which Burbury
had been leading him, and I had no time to take it off before
letting him go. In spite of this disability, with the rope trailing
behind him, the big black hound pulled down one of the birds.
I did not then know how valuable that ostrich was to be
to us.</p>

<p>We reached the Santa Cruz about 7 <span class="s08">A.M.</span>, and, after a considerable
amount of persuasion, we managed to induce the horses
to enter the water.</p>

<p>One of the great dangers of driving a <i>tropilla</i> into a river is
the chance that, when they do take to the water, your own mount
is very likely to rush in after them, and, before you can free
yourself, he will have carried you into the pull of the current, and,
of course, beyond your depth. Therefore it is always well to do
this kind of work bare-back, with only a bridle in your horse's
mouth, so that you can fling yourself off at any moment. It is also
well to unbuckle the loop of the rein; the omission of the latter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
precaution has resulted in the drowning of horses on many
occasions.</p>

<p>After seeing Burbury safely across, I started on my tramp back
to the camp at the mouth of the Leona. Fortunately, I carried
the whole ostrich with me, as I thought it was quite possible we
might be held back by bad weather in our voyage up the lake.</p>

<p>Cattle and Bernardo had stayed with the launch to prepare her
for probable rough handling by the waters of Lake Argentino, and
it was lucky they did so, as events proved. Cattle lighted a smoke
to give me my direction, and I was tempted to try a short cut,
which led me across an interminable series of sandhills mottled
with the tracks of foxes and lions (pumas).</p>

<p>When I got into camp we held a small festival in honour of the
launch's good behaviour, and drank to her health and good luck in
a cup of tea sweetened with the last of our sugar. But it never
does to rejoice prematurely, and our way along the north shore of
the lake turned out to be a battle with adverse winds, rain, and
vindictive bad weather.</p>

<p>The launch presented quite a different appearance by the time
I returned. The engine-room hatch had been covered by a canvas
hood, and bulwarks formed by lashing oars to strengthen the wire
railing which ran round the deck. The wheel had been rigged up
forward and protected by a weather-dodger. The cargo had been
carefully stowed, and, in fact, every precaution taken to ensure the
safety of the boat and to make her seaworthy.</p>

<p>The following is taken from my diary, which carries us from
hour to hour of the next few troubled days:</p>

<p>"<i>February 21.</i>&mdash;It blew pretty hard all through the morning,
and the bar of the Leona was quite impassable; but towards
evening the wind dropped slightly, so we got up steam and started.
We ran out over the bar, fighting our way by inches through the
heavy surf, but just beyond it the engine broke down, and we were
at the mercy of the wind and waves. It looked as if we were
being driven back to certain shipwreck, for the launch could not
live in the seas that were breaking on the bar. I cut loose one of
the oars which formed our bulwark, and both Cattle and I did
what we could to prevent her turning broadside on.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span></p>

<p>"I was engaged in this work at the stern when I heard Bernardo
shout, 'Mr. Preechard! Mr. Preechard!'</p>

<p>"I lay my full length along the deck and looked down at
Bernardo in the engine-room. He was holding on to the pump,
which was spouting steam and water. There was no room for two
people in the engine-room, nor in that angry sea was there much
possibility of my getting down there. So I lay along the port
decking, and slipped my feet under the after-hatch, thanking Providence
for my length, and so managed to hold the pump down
while Bernardo tried to repair the damage.</p>

<p>"Every now and then the seas caught us almost broadside on
and broke heavily, nearly sweeping me over with them. My head
being outside, I could see Cattle clinging on like a cat, and doing
all that man could do to keep us from swinging round. We were
on the bar, and scarcely twenty yards outside the fiercest of the
breakers. As it was, big seas kept sweeping over the launch and
crashing on her plates, making her roll appallingly.</p>

<p>"Between us and the shore was from one hundred to one
hundred and fifty yards of yeasty surge, dominated by a heavy
current setting south. The anchor continued to drag, and we
hung on while Bernardo fought with screws and nuts for our
lives. While we drifted back over the bar, nearly capsizing as
we did so, it became obvious that our only course lay in first
getting in the anchor and then putting it out again with a good
length of chain. In spite of the almost inconceivable rolling of
our craft, Cattle was successful in his attempt to do this, and
the launch came prow on to the breakers, which were losing
something of their fury as they crashed across the bar, twenty
yards in front of us.</p>

<p>"Meantime, Bernardo did not relax his efforts to get the engines
working once more. We were, as I have explained, a couple
of hundred yards from the shore, towards which the full force of
the wind, aided by the current I have mentioned as setting south
towards the mouth of the Santa Cruz, was drifting us.</p>

<p>"The anchor dragged again, and we had to undertake the
difficult business of getting it in, and taking a second chance of
dropping it on better holding ground.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>

<p>"We were tossing upon the bar for an hour and twenty minutes,
during which time poor Bernardo was violently seasick. It made
us laugh to hear him apostrophising the launch in the words, 'Be&mdash;she
make me&mdash;&mdash;' I will not conclude his sentence.</p>

<p>"At length, however, the Swede coaxed the engines into once
more performing their appointed duties, and as putting back would
have been a more difficult business than going forward, we began
to forge slowly ahead. It was now between five and six o'clock,
and there was a freezing south-west wind booming out of the
Cordillera, but when darkness fell this lulled for a short time and
we made the most of our chances to push forward. But, later, it
came on to blow heavily, the seas rose high and short, and in the
night-sky overhead only a few stars were visible through the
racing clouds. The wind veered to the south-west, and we were
off a lee shore set with rocks and icebergs, and there was no
anchorage for another twelve miles at least.</p>

<p>"The wind again veered a point to the southward after a time,
and it soon became evident that the launch, quivering and swept
continually by the waves, was making but little headway, while our
stock of fuel was growing low, and would not last us for the run to
the anchorage.</p>

<p>"I shouted the facts to Cattle, who was steering at the time, and
he suggested that we should try to make Ascensio's Bay&mdash;the
place where the famous horse-stealer and Gaucho, Brunel, used to
hide and slay the <i>tropillas</i> he robbed from the Indians. As Cattle
and I were discussing the question in shouts, a big sea swamped
us, almost carrying Cattle overboard with it and billowing along
the deck and nearly drowning out the engine-room.</p>

<p>"Cattle had made some trips about Lake Argentino in a canvas
boat, but had never been in Ascensio's Bay. But, as the night
was growing darker and the gale rising, we resolved to make for
it. At last, through the noise and battering of the grey-black
water, we reached the shelter of the promontory by the bay and
succeeded in feeling our way in. There we dropped anchors
from both bow and stern, drew off some water from the boiler
to make a <i>maté</i> which we drank, and afterwards lying down
in the after-hatch instantly fell asleep. Bernardo occupied the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
fore-hatch. We were too tired to dream of eating anything, and,
in spite of our close quarters and the cold, we did not wake till
morning.</p>

<p class="caption">WHERE THE SQUALLS CAME FROM</p>
</div>

<p>"The 23rd dawned calm and fine, and the first view of the spot
in which we were anchored made me think that something more
than mere luck had been with us during our entry upon the previous
night. The mouth of the bay was dotted with an outcrop of toothlike
rocks.</p>

<p>"The dawn developed into a morning with strong sun, and we
were off early. For two hours all went well. Then came a shiver
creeping across the glassy surface of the lake, after that a swell, and
in a matter of twenty minutes the quiet lake had become as nasty
and as angry a piece of water as can be imagined. This change is
eminently typical of the temper of the Andean lakes; they cannot
be depended upon from hour to hour. In the present instance at
7.45 <span class="s08">A.M.</span> we were steaming, as I have said, through calm water,
yet at 8.15 one sea of every four was dashing in a cloud of spray
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
over the boat. The reason of these sudden changes is not far to
seek.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>"Here, encircled by snow-capped mountains and bounded by
high cliffs, the waters of Argentino are often struck by swift squalls
descending from the gorges. The voyager may be, as we were,
many miles distant from the actual spot where the storm first
strikes, but the squall rushes down the funnel-like openings, bringing
a heavy sea with it. The seas are also very short, which more
than doubles the difficulty of navigation.</p>

<p>"On this occasion the sun was obscured and the outlook
to the westward became more and more menacing. The launch
began to creak and groan as usual, and to make but slight
headway. Far away glimmered an iceberg, which lay at the
entrance of the bay that marked our next harbourage. Soon it
became clear that we should never be able to reach its friendly
shelter without gathering a fresh supply of fuel. There was only
one alternative left to us, and that was to put in close to the shore,
and either wade or swim off to get more.</p>

<p>"The squall had now more or less spent itself, so we ran in
close, gaining some small shelter from a promontory which ended
in a big boulder.</p>

<p>"To attain such shelter as the promontory offered it was necessary
to make our way through a group of rocks. This we did, and
the wind sinking, Cattle and I scrambled ashore with the axes and
fell to work while Bernardo remained on board.</p>

<p>"Before, however, we had gathered half the required quantity of
wood a second squall, more heavy than the first, came screaming
across the lake, tearing the launch from her anchorage and almost
driving her upon the beach. We stripped off some of our clothes
and waded down into the water, and after a ten-minutes hard
struggle we succeeded in getting her back into deep water, where
she again dropped anchor.</p>

<p>"We returned to our work ashore, and cut and piled a good
store of fuel, almost as much as we needed, on the shingle ready to
carry aboard, but the violence of the waves put all hope of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
embarkation out of the question for the time. This was about
10 <span class="s08">A.M.</span>, and all day the wind increased in violence. A stately
procession of icebergs began to float down from the northerly arms
of the lake and squall succeeded squall. Soon it became evident
that the launch was drifting again, and I shouted to Bernardo, who
was now within hearing distance of the shore, to break up an oar
and use it for fuel. Luckily he had kept up fire in the furnace
and steam in the boiler, and as the weather was growing rapidly
worse, I ordered him to steam up over the anchor, and afterwards
to take the boat a quarter of a mile out and there drop anchor
with all the length of chain out that we possessed.</p>

<p>"What followed gave to us, I think, perhaps the most heartbreaking
moments we experienced throughout the whole trip.
While Bernardo was getting up enough steam to carry out orders,
the launch, still drifting, swooped nearer and nearer a reef of
submerged rocks. As she was in deep water, Cattle and I could do
nothing to help; we were compelled to watch helplessly from the
shore and rage at our own impotence. We called to Bernardo to
keep her off with an oar, and while he was unlashing one the
stern of the launch and, more than all, her precious propeller barely
escaped being smashed to pieces as she rose and fell on the rollers.
To us, looking from the shore, it seemed as if her last hour was
come, and it appeared hard indeed that she should have run safely
through so many perils only to end her existence in the lake before
we had had time to carry out any part of the exploration on which
we had set our hearts.</p>

<p>"At the crucial moment, however, Bernardo managed to pole
her clear and give her steam. She moved slowly out and anchored
far off shore.</p>

<p>"Evening drew on, but the wind showed no signs of dropping,
as it usually did at the rising or setting of the sun. There was
nothing for it but to make up our minds to a night ashore. We
found ourselves in a dilemma, for we had our whole supply of
food on shore, while, with the exception of my poncho, which
I brought with me to dry, Bernardo had all the rugs and
blankets in the launch. However, we made the best of it by
building up a big shelter of drift-wood and bushes. Then we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
lit a huge fire, for our clothes were soaking, and essayed to
dry them.</p>

<p>"Meantime the launch was riding out the storm as well as could
be expected, but taking a good deal of water aboard all the same. It
grew dark and the last we saw of her that night, her anchor was
holding and a big sea was racing aft. Bernardo had got on the
hatches and gone to bed, we supposed, for we did not see him the
whole time save once, and then he was bailing furiously."</p>

<p>The sky was black with the promise of rain, so we heaped
up the big fire, filled the cooking-pots with water, and spreading
the poncho on the ground took our places upon it. It was not
such a very bad night after all. Things rarely fulfil their
promise of disagreeableness&mdash;things of this kind anyway. We
passed the night somehow with the help of our pipes and an
occasional brew of sugarless tea. I never desired sugar so
much as then. Sugarless tea is far less warming than sugared.
Sleep was well-nigh impossible. It was too cold for that, and,
besides, one or other of us was always up and trying to pick out
the launch from the surrounding mass of spindrift and tumbling
black and grey waters.</p>

<p>In those latitudes the wind generally rises or falls, as the case
may be, with the setting or rising of the sun, and eagerly we waited
to see if the dawn would bring any change in our uncomfortable
position. But at dawn it was blowing, if anything, harder than ever.
The launch, however, was all right, although there was no sign of
Bernardo. We were driven to make a breakfast of berries from the
califate-bushes, of which a few mean specimens grew sparsely on the
hillside. It is a desolate place, that northern shore of Argentino.</p>

<p>When the sun came out we lay down and slept in its liquid
rays. A little after midday we cooked some <i>fariña</i> with mutton
fat and ate it. The gale was still tearing across the water, and we
began to count over our resources. We still had the greater part
of the ostrich which the hound Moses had killed on the way to
the River Santa Cruz, but it was an immature bird, and would
provide us with no more than three meagre meals. A couple of
handfuls of <i>fariña</i> were yet in the bottom of the bag, we had a
half-tin of tea and three-parts of a plug of tobacco.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span></p>

<p>As for Bernardo, he had now been nearly thirty hours without
food; indeed, to be accurate, he had been fifty hours without food,
thirty of them in the launch, for we had started work on a <i>maté</i>.
If we could have made him hear, he might have attached a line
to the life-buoy and floated her off, and we could have sent him
back supplies.</p>

<p>We had made certain of another night of discomfort, so we
gathered another big pile of firewood. Cattle's leg, that he had
strained on the previous day, was giving him much pain. But
when the sun was already dipping behind the summits of the
Cordillera the storm began to lull. We had little hope that
Bernardo could stand out much longer against starvation, so after
half an hour, as the seas were going down, we thought it well to
try and get off to the launch.</p>

<p>We went down to the beach, and, after much hailing, roused
the Swede. By signs I told him to come in as close as he dared,
which meant to within twenty or twenty-five yards of the shingle.
This time he got her in a better position, and we stripped and
waded in with the wood. It took us about forty journeys, and the
water was abominably cold. I do not think two men ever worked
much harder during the time we were at it, so before very long we
were on board with everything.</p>

<p>Fearing to remain near the shore we got up steam, and with
exceeding thankfulness bade good-bye to that inhospitable beach.
I asked Bernardo how much longer he thought he could have held
out. He said two days, and, in fact, appeared to think he had
been better off with the blankets and his pipe and the warmth of
the fore-hatch than we with food on shore. First and last he was
a fine fellow, patient, quiet and hard-working. As to his being
better off than Cattle and myself, that was a matter of individual
taste, I suppose. As a rule, indeed, the average man will, as far
as my experience goes, sacrifice his food to his bed nearly every
time, especially when the wind is blowing out of the snows.</p>

<p>Evening soon settled down into night, and we ran on by starlight
to our next anchorage, an almost land-locked bay, where we
made merry on the remains of the ostrich. I also discovered some
flour in the afterhold which had been overlooked, enough to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
three small dampers. We were uncommonly glad to resume our
rugs that night.</p>

<p>On the 24th we gathered more wood and put to sea. We
meant to reach the southern shore of the lake on the Burmeister
Peninsula, and there put in to a good anchorage not far from
Cattle's headquarters. But to do this it was necessary to pass
across Hell-gate, the opening to the north arm or North Fjord
of the lake, always a difficult stretch of water owing to the fact
that squalls perpetually blew down upon it from the funnel formed
by the winding gorges of the upper lake. We soon saw the two
dark bluffs beyond which the water wound away behind the outlying
buttresses of the mountains, whose snow-caps glimmered
against the wintry sky. We did not escape scot-free, for a squall
duly caught us, and the tossing sent everything in the launch adrift.
We ran by five icebergs and once the pump refused to act, and
things looked awkward, but in the end, to make a long story short,
we steamed into our shelter, which we called Cow Monte Harbour,
and tied up the launch with no small thankfulness, for she was
leaking badly through the cracked plate I have before referred to.</p>

<p>As the grass was dry we could not, with safety, make a fire sufficiently
large to signal Burbury to bring up the horses, as had been
arranged, so we sent on Bernardo with a message. He started off
in his big boots and we had no idea of the mischief he was to drop
into before we saw him again. He was accustomed to the pampas
round about the town of Santa Cruz, where you can light a fire
with impunity, but amongst the high grass growing in the valleys
of the foothills of the Cordillera a fire is certain to spread over an
immense area. Finding the way long, perhaps, Bernardo sent up
a brace of smokes as signals. We saw them, and knew at once
what was likely to happen.</p>

<img src="images/i_301.jpg" width="550" height="387" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE FIRE</p>
</div>

<p>When the horses arrived we bundled on to them and rode away
to try and stop the conflagration. There were two fires raging,
and our only chance lay in being able to arrest their spreading
beyond the shores of a dry lagoon, which mercifully extended
between them and the summer-dried, well-grassed marsh lying
under Mount Buenos Aires and Mount Frias, where Cattle's
pioneer-farm was situated. It would have been a distressing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
return for his co-operation and help had one of my men raised a
fire to sweep over his land and destroy his whole stock of horses,
sheep and cattle, a result that was for a time imminent.</p>

<p>We all provided ourselves with sheepskins and began our
attempt to beat out the fire. It was raging in bone-dry grass and
thorn and the flames leaped up and scorched our faces. Every
blow with the sheepskin sent up a shower of sparks that got into
one's eyes and ears, and it appeared as if we should never make
headway against the blaze. We might clear ten feet for a moment,
but as we turned away the flames would eat their way back and,
rekindling, flare up in waving tongues and roar again. Of course
we were to windward, on the lee side the smoke rolled away in a
solid cloud. I do not know how long we worked on that upper
ring of fire, but slowly we succeeded in beating it out by sheer
weight and repetition of blows.</p>

<p>The wind had by this time dropped a little, and the course of
the main blaze set downhill. At length we had beaten out a half-circle
and came to the crux of the affair. If we could but blot out
the fire to the south, where it was burning savagely among high
bushes and dry thorn, it was probable the situation would be
saved.</p>

<p>We took a short rest of four or five minutes and began again.
The smoke was gathering and rolling in great gouts, and we could
see nothing save the flames on the one side of us and the black
blinding dust on the other. As for ourselves, we were as black and
scorched as singed rats. We knew that the next ten minutes
would decide the matter.</p>

<p>Beside the fire ran a meandering cow or game track, and it
was at this line that we meant to try and cut off the flames, which
were rapidly spreading and getting out of hand. One was
conscious of nothing but the thud of the sheepskins and the
figures of the workers leaping in and out of the smoke and flame.
I have never witnessed a wilder scene. The men shouted as they
worked. It was like a battle-picture seen in a dream. All along
the cow-track, where the fire lipped it, the sheepskins rose and fell.
A dense dun-coloured cloud rolled out and up, lit every moment by
explosions of sparks.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span></p>

<p>Presently it became a race for a spot some 200 yards ahead,
where a line of green damp grass might stop the fire and force it
in another direction. To cut it off at this point would make the
remainder of our task more easy. But just on the nearer side of
the grass line a number of high bushes were growing, and their
strong roots and lower branches gave the flames a definite hold.
Now and again, too, one had to run back and stamp out some sudden
recrudescence of the flame. There is no need to describe the last
half-hour; only, when the yellow circle of fire had given place to
a smouldering black ring, we were ready to lie down on our
blackened sheepskins and feel neither glad nor sorry but only
wearily tired.</p>

<p>To beat out a fire is about the hardest sort of effort a man can
make, for no spell of rest can be obtained without losing the
results of previous labour. Afterwards, when we made a round of
the fires to make sure of safety, we found them sinking sullenly
into black deadness.</p>

<p>We were especially lucky in the direction taken by the fire, as,
had it burnt along any other line, it is almost certain that our camp
and all that we possessed would have been destroyed. Such a
disaster actually occurred to Cattle some years ago in the north of
the country. He was then journeying with two companions, when
a half-breed boy he had with him was foolish enough to allow a
camp-fire to spread among the surrounding grass. The pioneers
were able to save nothing but a pair of <i>boleadores</i> and a Winchester
rifle with the seven cartridges that happened to be in it. The
party fortunately possessed several hounds, by whose efforts the
stock of meat was kept up, otherwise it is more than likely that
their case would have been a serious one.</p>

<p>The interval between the time of our starting for Lake Viedma
and our return was in all but eleven days. During those eleven
days much happened that brought back most vividly to me old
boyish dreams of travel and romance. I had realised some of
them, but risk and adventure, which enchant us in the glamour of
far-off contemplation, are apt on nearer view to lose in romance
what they gain in reality.</p>

<p>On the same day of the fire, news, brought by some wandering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
Indian or Gaucho, reached us; rumours passing from mouth to
mouth as they will in a wonderful manner over the most sparsely
populated country. The first we heard was a report of war, a real
war-scare, such as might have originated from the fertile imagination
of a Haïtian journalist. The Russians were said to be
marching upon India, and France had joined hands with them
against England.</p>

<p>It was but the barest outline, yet it shook and excited us out
there in the ends of the earth just as if we had formed items of a
crowd in Fleet Street.</p>

<p>Following on this came that other heavy tidings indeed, the
death of the Queen. We took off our hats, and at first nothing
was said. The news struck each man of us. There was a sense
of loss and of the blankness of a personal calamity, which expressed
themselves at last in a few odd homely words.</p>

<p>There, 7000 miles away, the abstract idea of the nation became
concrete. One had no picture in one's mind of England that did
not bear in the foreground, filling the heart and eye, that gracious,
royal, simple, noble figure, which for so long had drawn out towards
itself the highest patriotism of the race. The tumult of a nation's
mourning was taken up and echoed feebly here as in other remote
corners of the earth. Thousands of pens have borne witness to the
world-wide sorrow. No need to say more, but while I write the
scene comes back, as some moments of one's life will and do come&mdash;the
broad blue heavens, the wide lake, the wind, the smell of
grass and califate-bushes, the grasping after shattered fancies, and
the heavy acceptance of the hour assigned.

</p>

<p>Very different to the easy sport afforded by the huemul was our
experience of hunting wild cattle in the forests which clothe more
or less densely the ravines and slopes of the lower Andes. These
forests, which in some parts are
absolutely impenetrable in the spring,
because at that season the <i>pantanos</i>
are saturated with the rains and
melting snow, give shelter to many
scattered herds of wild cattle.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a name="i_306" id="i_306"></a>
<img src="images/i_306.jpg" width="285" height="201" alt="" />
<p class="caption">FORESTS UNDER THE SNOWS WHERE<br />
WILD CATTLE BREED</p>
</div>

<p>Captain Musters, writing in 1871,
speaks of hunting these animals
under the Cordillera, but their
existence in a wild state dates
from a far earlier period&mdash;in fact, from the time of the first
Spanish occupation, when cattle escaped from the Valdez Peninsula,
and roaming over the pampas at length reached the high
grass and sheltered places of the Cordillera. Finding these
entirely to their liking, they have ever since lived and bred in that
region; their numbers, no doubt, being from time to time increased
by deserters from the unfenced farms on the east coast of Patagonia.
It is a strange thing that cattle which escape almost
invariably head north-west towards the Cordillera. This fact has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
been commented on to us by many different Gauchos and cattle-owners
up and down the east coast.</p>

<p>The older herds have lost the smooth aspect of domesticated
animals and thrown back to the shaggy front, longer horns and
rough-haired hide characteristic of wild cattle. As to the special
parts of Patagonia in which wild cattle are most plentiful, it would
be of little use to give a list of them. Should a herd stray in the
plains, the Indians will soon make them change their quarters and
return to take refuge among the woods and ravines of the foothills.
Inside this forest-land the Indians will never venture, and there
the emancipated bull thoroughly enjoys himself. Even the beasts
belonging to the farmers lead a wandering life, and at a short
distance from the settlements are shy of the approach of man, and
have to be rounded up by mounted Gauchos. Those of them that
have been inside a corral and regained their liberty are every whit
as wild as the wild cattle proper. Being caught with a lasso and
branded is by no means an experience calculated to instil any deep
confidence in mankind into the mind of a calf.</p>

<p>In the Cordillera the herds are extremely wideawake. When
a point is disturbed, they always go higher up into the mountains,
and almost invariably leave that particular neighbourhood under
cover of the ensuing night. Their climbing powers are extraordinary.
Wherever a guanaco can go, a wild bull can follow
him. Their tracks are regularly and clearly marked, and they
appear to move along precisely the same paths from feeding-place
to feeding-place. The snows of winter force them to lower
ground, but in my opinion the herds never penetrate very deep
into the Cordillera. Precisely how far they go it would be hard to
determine, but they seldom ascend to the higher levels, preferring
to wander about the outer spurs of the lower hills. There is a
spot on the south side of the Lake Rica where they appear to
make their way farther into the recesses of the mountains than in
any other district.</p>

<p>Patagonia, as the reader will by this time realise, cannot be
called a big-game country in the sense of affording any variety of
large animals for the benefit of the sportsman. But whoever goes
into the Cordillera will find the wild bulls of their forests well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
worthy of his attention, for they give as excellent sport as any big
game in the world. A point which must tell greatly in their
favour in the eyes of some people is the fact that the pursuit of
them is a pleasure by no means unattended by danger.</p>

<p>The first day on which I attempted to find wild cattle we
sighted two herds, one about half way up the hillside and the
other higher, almost upon the snow-line. We had gone out rather
with the idea of prospecting, having but little hope of being so
lucky as to get a shot. Mr. Cattle, Burbury, and myself made up
the party, and while Cattle hid in the direction towards which
the herd might be expected to break, Burbury and I undertook
the stalk. We separated, and I finally got within two hundred
yards of a dun-coloured bull; but his position was so bad that it
seemed a pity to shoot. The herd ultimately moved into a strip
of forest high on the shoulder of the mountain, and we failed to
locate it again.</p>

<p>Upon this followed a period when the memory of the shot I
might have taken rankled as a thorn in the flesh. The difficulty
of finding a herd was very great. We went out several days in
succession and failed to catch sight of a single horn. For twelve
days we searched from dawn to dark and found nothing. Yet
these days, which resulted in a total bag of two huemules, were
infinitely more sporting than were those in the neighbourhood of
the River de los Antiguos, where a large number of animals might
have been secured. On four occasions fresh tracks were found,
and in that keen invigorating air the hunting of such a quarry was
a sport for the gods.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_309" id="i_309"></a>
<img src="images/i_309.jpg" width="550" height="385" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A GLADE IN THE LAKE RICA FOREST</p>
</div>

<p>There is a picturesque sentence in one of Mr. Kipling's writings,
in which he speaks of a life "spent on blue water in the morning
of the world." Each savage of us has, I suppose, some such
ideal existence, and if that be so, mine would be passed in hunting
some great horned quarry upon frozen hills in a land where no
wind too strong should blow, and where the views of water and of
peaks should be in all shades of separate and glorious blue.
What a splendid place such a happy hunting-ground would be!
Quite different to the happy hunting-grounds of the North
American Indian, the Tehuelche or the Eskimo&mdash;the latter, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
the way, looks forward to a paradise where he will lie for ever
upon the sleeping-bench in the warmth and eat decomposed seals'
heads! The nomad hunter races kill to eat in any manner or by
any means, the romance of sport is in one sense lacking in them;
but in my happy hunting-ground there will be Irish elk with
mighty spreading horns upon those wondrous hills....</p>

<p>We have wandered far away from our subject. I think it may
be said that during those twelve blank days every method of
hunting wild cattle had a fair trial. Upon the northern slopes of
Mount Buenos Aires (which, I must mention, is very far distant
from Lake Buenos Aires, being, in fact, surrounded on three sides
by the waters of Lake Argentino) there is comparatively little
wood, although there is much thick high brush, so that&mdash;as in
Sardinian moufflon-shooting&mdash;one may spy the ground two or
three times in the day, and yet fail to discover a herd hidden in
the brush or in one of the many water-worn ravines. Nevertheless,
this place was the most open ground which we hunted, and
was far superior to the Lake Rica side of the mountain, upon
which cluster dense forests of antarctic beech, through which it is
impossible to see more than twenty or thirty yards, and often not
so far.</p>

<p>Once or twice I tried sitting up for bulls at their drinking-places,
but never with any success. The fact is, that the forests
they range through are so well watered with streams, <i>pantanos</i>
and springs, that they have a score of drinking-places to choose
from, therefore the chances are twenty to one against getting a
shot. But in a district where water is scarce, it seems to me that
this plan might meet with success. The best sport was undoubtedly
that which we enjoyed towards Punta Bandera, a headland
forming the north point of Mount Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>It was here, upon the thirteenth day of my hunting, about an
hour and a half before dark, that I perceived a fine point of seventeen
upon the hillside in front of me. They were, however, in a
spot utterly impossible of approach, in the centre of a bald ridge
upon the summit of which they were silhouetted against the black
background of the mountain beyond them. Deep gullies cut up
the intervening ground, and after advancing as near as might be,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
I lay down and possessed my soul in patience, waiting until the
moment when the herd should choose to move. They had left
me time enough and to spare for observing them through the
glasses. Three black bulls, a yellow one and a red were the pick
of the herd, there were some cows and well-grown calves also, and
these last began to proceed very leisurely down a cow-track, which
would ultimately lead them on to ground where they might be
stalked. I had tied up my horse in a hollow among some bushes
of <i>Leña dura</i>. It was a glorious evening and the shadows stood
out very distinctly, so much so that from the slightly higher ground
I could see with the telescope the movements of the shadows of
the bulls. The bases of the mountain were steeped in clear still
dusk, there was no wind, and the whole scene lived again fantastically
in the smooth waters of the lake. When one is shooting, no
matter how intent one may be upon the game, it is natural to
observe these things and enjoy them, in a secondary sense possibly,
but none the less keenly. Anyway, there was plenty of time to
observe, for the herd took it easy, and now and then one of the
big bulls would come to a standstill and stare about him. The
yellow bull especially took my fancy, the spread of his horns must
have been over four feet. At length, however, the last of the herd
disappeared into a gully and I hastened forward. About a mile
separated me from the point, and this I covered at good speed; the
final bit necessitated a crawl, which ended on the edge of a low
rocky plateau. Here I peered through some fuchsia-bushes. To
my disgust the herd had quickened their pace, and were a little
beyond range upon a space of level land beneath me; they lingered
here for an uncommonly long time, giving me ample opportunity
to study the surrounding cow-tracks and the grass-bare wallows.
Meantime the precious light was fading, and the reflections of the
snow-peaks were beginning to blur and darken in the mirror of
the lake. Ahead of the herd were a number of tracks, which ran
parallel with each other for a certain distance, but afterwards
branched into different directions. I could see them dimly through
the telescope. Should they happen to take the lowest of these,
they would be delivered into my hands, for it led immediately
under a cliff over which I could get within a few yards of them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
This track finally emerged upon the shore of the lake. Under the
leadership of a yellow cow, the whole point began presently to
descend this very track. As soon as the last of them was out of
sight, I rushed on to secure my shot. On the way I spied from
behind a boulder on high ground the coveted old yellow bull
knee-deep in the lake, drinking. Over the first part, which was
high, I had to be very careful, but once this spot was passed,
coming to the conclusion that as the light was fading so fast the
race would probably be to the swift, I hurried. Alas! a deep
gully again blocked my way, and it was necessary to make a
détour of about half a mile through breast-high bushes. While
passing amongst the brush much care had, of course, to be exercised
to avoid the breaking of twigs or branches, as the herd was not far
off. When at last I arrived at the cliff above the spot where the
herd had disappeared, I could not see the sights of my rifle. I
would have given much for two minutes of moonlight, for I could
hear the noise of the bulls moving within twenty yards, and the
smell of them was distinctly perceptible to my senses, sharpened
by months of a natural life. The whole herd had packed pretty
close together on the edge of the shingle, but it was already too
dark for me to shoot, so I retired after a while, comforting myself
with the prospect of following the herd in the morning.</p>

<p>Yet although I followed, I never found. The herd, as was
to be read from the tracks, struck upwards after leaving the lake
and entered a wide piece of forest, in which no day was ever long
enough to find them. Several times after this we were on the
tail of a herd, and again and again lost them in the dense forests.
The ground over which one had to move was extremely baulking
to success; it was covered with broken sticks, dead trees, and
branches, dry, rotten, and ready to snap beneath the smallest
pressure. Sometimes after a long stalk one found oneself in
a patch of dry dead bushes, the breaking of any bough of which
would certainly spoil all chance of success. Again, one could not
see more than from twenty to fifty yards ahead, and in thick forests
much less. A herd will stand quite still till within thirty yards if
you have not perceived them, but the moment your eye catches
one of theirs the animal makes off, taking his companions with him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span></p>

<p>A bull, if you wound him and he charges, will charge but once,
and if he misses you, will pass on. But a cow is quite another
affair. She will return to the charge again and again, and will
kneel down in order to horn her antagonist. She is at least twice
as formidable an antagonist as a bull.</p>

<p>The next time I saw wild cattle was once again upon Punta
Bandera, and upon this occasion I had my first shot. It was early
in the morning when I made out the point with the glasses, feeding
about half-way up a spur of the mountain-side. Determined this
time not to be disappointed, a whole day was spent in a series of
very careful man&oelig;uvres. All went well until I entered a patch of
dry dead growth, so thick as to make it impossible to move without
giving audible indication of one's presence. While lying
among this stuff debating what course to pursue, to my delight a
black and white bull, evidently the leader of the herd, rose, grunted
once or twice, and, followed by the whole of his companions, began
to come towards me. He got to within 150 yards, and there
coming upon the edge of the dry stuff among which I lay hidden,
turned tail and moved slowly in the opposite direction. To shoot
through the undergrowth, which was about five feet high, was, of
course, impossible. Yet there was no chance of the animals, while
roving in search of pasture, reaching any better position with regard
to me, while any movement on my part to approach them must
have been through the dead bushes. There was nothing for it
then but to stand up and take the chance of a shot. A twig
snapped in my rising and the herd charged furiously away. A red
bull, which had travelled higher than his fellows upon the slope of
the mountain, gave very much the best chance as he raced along
nearly broadside on.</p>

<p>He turned a complete somersault to the shot and lay so still
that I thought I had killed him. As I went towards him, however,
he scrambled to his feet and galloped after the retreating herd, and
although upon their tracks for the greater part of the evening, at no
point on the way, nor at the spot where he had fallen, did I find any
traces of blood. I therefore concluded that he had put his foot in a
hole, and that I had missed him clean. Since my return I have
heard the end of the history. The red bull was found dead quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
close to where I had shot him. He was, I understand, hit through
the lungs.</p>

<p class="caption">The Father of the Herd.</p>
</div>

<p>After this shot on Punta Bandera, the herd left that locality, as
they invariably do, and most of the remainder of our hunting took
place upon the Lake Rica, or southern side, of the great mountain.
One of the pleasantest days we enjoyed was upon Mount Frias
where a large point of cattle had gone up beyond the snow-line.
On that occasion, when above the snow-line, I saw a pampa-fox,
some guanaco and a few ostriches. Quite a number of small
birds that I was unable to identify, as I could not shoot them, were
feeding upon a red berry which grows beneath the snow.</p>

<p>I think of earthly situations I would choose that for the location
of my happy hunting-ground where life throbs and quickens in the
keen air, and where, in the shelter of the black forest of antarctic
beech-trees, one can hear the wind from the snows moaning and
crying among the tree-tops, and dropping the leaves, painted with
red and yellow, upon the soft mossy mid-forest carpet.</p>

<p>While on Mount Frias my attention was drawn away from the
cattle by what I took to be an instance of albinism in the guanaco.
There was an immense herd of five hundred or perhaps more in an
open hollow, and among them I observed a very white specimen,
but on looking at it through the glasses it proved to be piebald
rather than truly white.</p>

<p>My next excursion was made on much lower ground in
the direction of Lake Rica. We had observed some spots to
which a herd returned night after night.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The success with
which the herds can pick their way over bad ground such as
this and through trees, and most of all across the giant trunks,
decaying and rotten, many of which must have fallen years ago,
is extraordinary. Had it not been for the openings broken by
the passage of the cattle, we should have been unable to penetrate
the denser parts of the woods without axes. In spite of his
being such a heavy brute, a bull can always overtake a horse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
in these spongy swamps, or indeed in most cases over very bad
ground.</p>

<p>In the winter, which was now only too quickly coming upon us,
wild-cattle shooting becomes, as does the shooting of all game in
Patagonia, much easier than it ever is during the rest of the year.
The herds descend to the low ground, being driven downwards by
degrees while the snows creep day by day lower on the mountain-sides.
As they desert the heights the area in which one may expect
to meet them naturally becomes smaller, and on the more level
country they can be followed with less trouble. The hunting in this
big forest was quite different to that on Punta Bandera, the sole
method here being to find comparatively fresh tracks and follow
them up, there being no possibility among that dense growth of
spying animals from a distance.</p>

<p>One day I had entered an extremely wet and boggy strip of
forest and came upon new tracks, which I followed in and out
among the trees for some hours. At length they led me up
another hill into another belt of forest. I remember that under
the hill I took a "spell," and at that moment, although I could
not see them, the cattle were within one hundred and fifty yards
of me. Fortunately I was very quiet and did not light my pipe,
but presently went on. Arrived at the top of the hill, I peered
through the branches and saw a fine brindled bull just in the act
of rising to his feet. One of the outlying cows had winded me
and had given the alarm. My bull was off at a gallop, and there
was nothing to do but to send the heavy Paradox bullet into the
only part of him that was visible as he dashed away. The shot
took effect, he staggered but the second barrel brought him down
in good earnest. A third hit him in the centre of the forehead,
which is a deadly shot indeed, but with a smallbore rifle one must be
careful to place one's bullet clear of the shaggy curl. The first shot
had, I discovered, gone forward and upward, touching the backbone;
the second was a fair behind the shoulder shot. I write this to illustrate
the amount of shooting that a wild bull will sometimes take.</p>

<img src="images/i_319.jpg" width="550" height="353" alt="" />
<p class="caption">AS IT WAS IN THE BEGINNING</p>
</div>

<p>There are few higher joys in a sportsman's life than the pipe
which he smokes after a successful shot, but the skinning of the
quarry that comes later is a very different matter. This is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
especially the case when the animal has dropped in such a spot
that one cannot turn it over owing to its weight.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_321" id="i_321"></a>
<img src="images/i_321.jpg" width="550" height="405" alt="" />
<p class="caption">EDGE OF FOREST</p>
</div>

<p>For this forest shooting a 12-bore Paradox or jungle-gun is as
good as any. I had one which was made for me by Jeffrey and Co.,
and with it one could make a very decent pattern at seventy yards.
In open ground I generally used a Mauser, but this rifle was, of
course, not heavy enough for forest shooting at a dangerous quarry,
where most of the shots were within forty yards.</p>

<p>Once again on Punta Bandera I saw the big yellow bull. One
day I watched the great herd of wild cattle straggling slowly down
the opposite hillside, the cows with their calves trotting alongside
them, and the magnificent yellow bull bringing up the rear in
solitary state. They were in a hopelessly unget-at-able position,
so that one could only watch them. The air was so clear that, with
the telescope, it was possible to make out the tracks of each
separate animal as the herd descended the incline.</p>

<p>While I was still engaged in watching the cattle, I saw something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
brown move on a knoll above me and about four hundred
yards distant. A huemul doe had appeared upon it. She was not
frightened, and was entirely unaware of my proximity. Soon she
was joined by a buck, a four-pointer with nice clean horns. There
were now two sporting interests in the landscape, the greater and
the less. The cattle had turned and were moving relentlessly
upwards over bare ground where a stalk was out of the question. I
turned my attention therefore again upon the huemules, from whom
I found myself separated by two deep gullies.</p>

<p>In an hour's time the cattle had diminished to mere specks
upon the side of the mountain, and a strong wind having arisen,
which blew from the huemules towards me, I thought I might
safely try a shot at the buck. It knocked him clean head over
heels. He proved to be in fine coat, and I at once set to work to
skin him. By the time I had finished it had grown quite dark.
As for the herd, they were too clever for me. I never sighted
them again, but that big yellow bull I shall often see in dreams.
Perhaps I may be permitted to meet with him when I attain
to the happy hunting-ground of my desires.</p>

<p>Apart from the rifle, there are other ways of hunting wild cattle,
but in the practice of these open ground is naturally a necessity.
<i>Boleadores</i> will rarely stay on a bull, but the lasso is an efficient
weapon, and on horseback a Mauser pistol will take a lot of beating.
In the last instance the hunter gallops level with his
quarry and trusts to his horse to carry him clear of danger in
case of accident. As a rule, wild cattle avoid open ground, and
if they chance to be away from the cover of the forest keep a
sharp watch. Their hides are worth about £1 more or less
when sold in the settlements, a value which is enough to turn
every man's hand against them, were there any men in those districts
whose hands might be so turned. But the wild cow will long
continue to breed in her chosen solitudes, and indeed she is well
able to take care of herself. From all I saw of wild cattle, they
yield the palm as a sporting animal to few others in the world.

</p>

<p>It will be conceded that few subjects have more interest than the
attitude assumed by wild animals towards man on first acquaintance
with him. I think it may be claimed that we had exceptional opportunities
for the study of this very important question. In most other
districts into which white men have passed for the first time, they
have usually been preceded by aborigines, who have made that
declaration of war which must invariably be given forth between
men and <i>feræ naturæ</i>. But in Patagonia, when the beat of the
Tehuelches is left behind, there are many places to which one may
penetrate where the animals have never before seen man. We
here come to a question which is as old as the world&mdash;what were
the original relations existing between man and beast? On man's
side we know the position; on that of the wild animal we can
rarely obtain evidence at first hand, especially in these latter days,
when the earth is overrun and populated in almost every habitable
region.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the description given of Patagonia that
some of its remoter portions offer a unique field for observing the
effect of man's appearance on the behaviour of animals that have
had no previous knowledge of him. These places present some
of the few localities left untouched by the presence of human
beings. The value of any evidence still obtainable as to the bearing
of wild creatures when brought into contact with human beings for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
the first time can therefore hardly be over-estimated. The chances
of observing details of conduct and the spontaneous attitude of
animals under these conditions have unfortunately become exceedingly
rare and are daily growing rarer. Soon there will be no
spot where such facts can be collected. Knowing this, I made
every effort to gather all the data possible.</p>

<p>Large herds of guanaco patrol the country in all directions;
how far they are local in their habits it is not easy to decide, but I
was informed by several people that such and such a marked
guanaco had been in such a district since such and such a winter,
therefore I am led to conclude that the guanaco are more or less
local in their movements. In the summer they are to be found on
the high pampa, and in the winter the herds descend to the lower
ground. But all the evidence that I could gather pointed to the
fact that this periodic migration is limited in extent, and that certain
herds belong, as it were, to certain districts and live and die within
a comparatively small area.</p>

<p>During peculiarly hard winters, however, they will gather in
very large herds and travel a good distance to the low grounds,
where water and some pasture are still to be procured.</p>

<p>The guanacos that we met with on the basalt plateau to the
south of Lake Buenos Aires probably visit the shores of the lake
during the winter time. In the inverse order of things no travellers
ever cross the basalt plateau in summer, nor do they visit the lake
in winter; we may therefore conclude that the guanaco were in
that region unacquainted with man. The following is taken from
my diary while we were crossing the plateau:</p>

<p>"<i>December 28.</i>&mdash;To-day we saw great numbers of guanaco,
many of which have in all probability never before beheld a human
being. They were about as tame as English park deer, allowing
us to approach on foot to within seventy or eighty yards, and, in
the case of the old bucks, to within fifty yards. The females were,
of course, much shyer. It was a beautiful sight to watch the great
herd leaping up and down the hillside and dashing through the
outcrop of black fragments of basalt. The bucks almost invariably
kept between us and their females. On some occasions, when I
came suddenly round a hill upon a herd, the old buck would gallop
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
up between me and the herd and stalk along, uttering his peculiar
neighing cry. There were numbers of young guanacos among
these herds. These very quickly attain considerable speed, and
at a fortnight old give the hounds some trouble to overtake
them. Young guanacos, when cut off from the herd, can be
approached by man. This morning I succeeded in galloping
between one and the herd to which it belonged. He allowed me,
on horseback, to come within six yards, but on a dog appearing in
the distance he at once dashed away. Young guanacos, when
separated from the herd, will follow a troop of horses, running
fearlessly beside the riders."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_325" id="i_325"></a>
<img src="images/i_325.jpg" width="550" height="304" alt="" />
<p class="caption">GUANACOS ON SKY-LINE</p>
</div>

<p>In contrast to the above I give a record of another meeting
with these animals at a later date. I find in my diary on May 13,
1901, written in the <i>cañadon</i> of the River Katarina at the upper
end of the north-west arm of Lake Argentino, as follows:</p>

<p>"I saw two herds of guanacos, which were certainly unacquainted
with man. They were extremely wild, not allowing me
to approach within six hundred yards. I to-day hunted these
guanacos with the idea of observing whether they would take to
the water, or perhaps pass into the forest, which was plentiful in
patches. They did neither, but kept to the bare cliffs on the edge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
of the peninsula, and when driven away from the cliffs at one end
simply sought the shelter of the cliffs at the other."</p>

<p>Again, on the tableland between the River de los Antiguos and
the River Jeinemeni the guanacos were extraordinarily tame.
Only one traveller had been there before us (Mr. Waag). The
guanacos permitted us to advance to within two hundred yards, and
one, which was lying down, allowed me to come within sixty paces
walking upright. At this distance I determined to see what effect
the crawling attitude would produce, and for this purpose I retreated
and again approached, this time on my hands and knees. I was
still one hundred and fifty yards from the animal when he got up,
and I had not proceeded many steps nearer before he bounded
away. From this instance it may be deduced that while the herd
evidently understood and feared the approach of predatory enemies
in a crouching attitude, man upright in his natural position inspired
relatively little fear but rather curiosity, for the guanaco remained
lying down and staring at me as long as I appeared walking towards
him.</p>

<p>On yet another occasion in the <i>cañadon</i> of the River Katarina,
the first sight that a herd, seventeen strong, had of us, was when
we were on board the launch. They raced up to the bank of the
river and stared at us, only darting off ten or twelve paces when
the irrepressible Bernardo saluted them with a whistle. Shortly
afterwards we anchored and went ashore, but the guanacos would
not allow us on foot to approach within half a mile, although when
we were hidden they returned to the neighbourhood of the launch
without fear. In the evening they retired far up the valley, where
I again saw them upon the following day. They were very timid,
and I could get no nearer to them than three hundred yards,
although I made one or two attempts to do so.</p>

<p>There was one point which was distinctly noticeable, and which
these observations bear out. Guanacos, unacquainted with man,
will allow him to approach in the first instance much closer if he
happens to be accompanied by a troop of horses, as was the case
with us in our experience of the herds on the basalt plateau. In
fact, guanacos will reconnoitre a troop of horses, even though
there may be men among them, at a very much shorter distance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
than they will venture upon with regard to a camp or a group of
men without horses.</p>

<p>Districts where the Indians hunt the guanaco may be passed
over as having no bearing on the subject in hand. There the
herds are, of course, extremely wild and hard of approach. But it
is interesting to note that near the coast, where there are numbers
of guanaco, they are comparatively tame. Shepherds on horseback
from the farms pass and repass within sight of the herds, who grow
accustomed to the experience and become easy of access to within
one hundred yards.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>One day in the October of 1900, when at the farm of Mr. Greenshields
at Bahia Camerones, I took a long ride through the
<i>cañadones</i> where the shepherds were wont to pass. Again and
again the guanaco herds allowed me to ride up close to them, and
I invariably found that a single animal was shyer of approach than
a herd.</p>

<p>Guanacos are very easily domesticated, and in time become obtrusively
playful and affectionate. It is a favourite trick with them
to come behind their human friends rearing and striking them in the
back with their knees, which results in a more or less painful fall.</p>

<p>Curiosity is a largely developed mental characteristic in the
<i>feræ naturæ</i> of Patagonia. The first and overwhelming impulse
of nearly all the wild creatures (the ostrich, <i>Rhea darwini</i>, excepted)
appeared to be to investigate the aspect and actions of man.
Upon the coast-farms the guanaco, grown <i>blasé</i> by familiarity, will
not take any interest in man's movements unless he indulges in
some unusual and fantastic antics, such as lying on his back and
kicking his legs in the air. Then an otherwise indifferent herd
will gather and watch the proceedings with much attention.</p>

<p>As far as my experience goes, no wild creature, save the ostrich,
on first beholding man, straightway travels out of sight. All the
others, according to whether they naturally are shy or the reverse,
retire to a more or less remote distance, and from there watch the
doings of the intruder upon their solitudes.</p>

<p>Of Patagonian game the least hunted is the deer of the Andes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
(<i>Xenelaphus bisulcus</i>). We came in contact with these animals
both near Lake Buenos Aires and Lake Argentino. At the
former place, my friend, Mr. Waag, had marched through the
Gorge of the River de los Antiguos, where most of my observations
were made. As he was working very hard on his geographical
surveys at the time, he did not shoot much, and I think
it more than probable that man was an unknown factor of existence
to the huemules of that region before we came upon the scene.</p>

<p>My observations of huemules consistently show that their first
attitude towards man is one of curiosity and confidence. I instance
some cases to bear out this assertion.</p>

<p>On December 9, 1900, I had just shot a guanaco upon the
western shore of the River de los Antiguos, when a huemul buck
about a year old, no doubt startled by the noise, dashed past
me within twenty yards, and, catching sight of me, stopped quite
still and fixed his eyes upon me. As I remained motionless, he
advanced several paces and again halted, looking at me. I was
sitting upon the body of the guanaco I had killed, the wind
happening to be blowing from the deer towards me. We kept
these respective positions for about five minutes. I then lit my
pipe. At the scraping of the match he retreated a little, but
gathering courage soon paused again. I rose slowly to my feet
and advanced steadily towards him. He waited until I was quite
close before he sprang away and disappeared from sight up the
<i>barranca</i>.</p>

<p>Again in May 1901, being then in the <i>cañadon</i> of the River
Katarina near Lake Argentino, I saw from the boat what I
took to be the horns of a huemul against the background of
the low forest. I landed and crossed the swamp in the direction
of the thicket. Here, coming into an open space, I saw
the buck to whom the horns belonged. Behind him the head
and shoulders of a doe were visible projecting from a bush. I
continued to walk on till I came within something like one
hundred yards, when I sat down behind a fragment of rock and
hid myself from their view. The sun was, I remember, but a
hands-breadth above the Cordillera, and I made up my mind that I
would not move until its lower rim had dipped beneath the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
snow-peaks. At the time I had set for myself I peered round
the edge of the rock very carefully&mdash;as slowly as one peers when
one is observing the movements of a gaggle of Scotch grey-lags.
Imagine my surprise when there, not ten yards away, appeared
the face of the doe, her gaze fixed upon mine! On seeing me
thus suddenly she ran back to the shelter of the undergrowth
from which she had originally emerged, and from which the buck
during the interval had not stirred. The shades of evening were
fast falling, and I was obliged to make an end of my watching for
lack of light.</p>

<p>But undoubtedly the most remarkable example of the natural
tameness of the huemul occurred on May 9. I was in the same
<i>cañadon</i>, and on this occasion had the luck to secure a photograph
of the doe as she went away. It was about noon that I,
being on my way up the <i>cañadon</i> in a northerly direction, heard
a stick break in a thicket near by, and a moment afterwards a
huemul buck came into view. Fortunately I had not caught
his eye, and he remained looking out from a patch of bushes,
wondering, I suppose, what strange animal this could be that was
coming towards him. Pretending that I had not observed him, I
threw myself down among the high grass and waited for developments.
The buck snorted twice or thrice and advanced to within
thirty yards of where I lay. He stood upon the side of a hummock,
flanked by his two hinds. They were shortly joined by a third,
which came up out of the hollow behind them. I lay perfectly
still. The buck halted, but the hinds came on till within a few feet
of me. The buck now approached on the right; he was a four-pointer.
The does had winded me. Two of them were mature, the third
a half-grown hind. Before five minutes were over the hinds had
come so near as to be almost touching me. Presently the half-grown
hind sniffed my boot and started back, taking the other
three with her. They drew nearer a second time, the buck coming
within a yard of me, and dropping his horns as though to turn me
over. I did not quite like the action, as it might have meant more
than a mere push, and therefore raised myself gently to a sitting
position. The deer retreated about thirty yards, and there stood,
not taking their eyes from me for a considerable time. Seeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
that no further approach of the deer was likely, I finally got up and
went my way. The does followed me for fifty yards or so, the
buck remaining stationary, and then all four bounded off into the
woods whence they had come.</p>

<p>In spite of this original confidingness exhibited by the huemul
to man when unknown, he appears to be readily rendered wild and
timid. Burbury saw some of these animals near the Engineers'
camp above Lake Buenos Aires. They had probably been hunted
by Mr. Waag's party and were excessively wild, flying on the
farthest glimpse of man. This observation was confirmed by
Humphrey Jones, who told me that the huemules living in the
woods near the Welsh colony of The 16th October are wilder than
any other creature, and that to shoot one is a feather in the caps
of the local hunters. I cannot say whether they are easily tamed
when in captivity, for I came across no instance of a huemul kept
by man.</p>

<p>So far, then, my observations on the huemul.</p>

<p>Concerning the puma, I have never heard of any man being
attacked near the settlements by this animal, and, indeed, authentic
instances of its acting as the assailant are very few and far
between. All those of which I gathered reliable evidence
occurred in remote places, distant from the beat of man. Mr.
Waag told me of a puma which did not retreat from his party
in the Cordillera, but gave manifest signs of anger and a readiness
to attack. Another case is that of Dr. Francisco P. Moreno,
who, upon the banks of the River Leona, a river which flows
between Lake Argentino and Lake Viedma, and is seldom
visited, was attacked by a puma. He was, he informs me,
walking wrapped in the skin of a guanaco, and he fancies the
animal may have mistaken him for a guanaco. It sprang upon
his shoulders and tore him under the chin with its claws, but was
luckily beaten off by his companion and killed. This puma was
found to be in milk, a fact which, arguing the presence of her
young near at hand, probably accounted for the unusual outbreak
of fierceness. The young were searched for but not discovered.</p>

<p>A third instance is that of Mr. Arenberg, one of the Argentine
Boundary Commissioners, who was mauled by a puma in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
neighbourhood of Lake Buenos Aires, at a spot probably hitherto
unvisited by man. He was seriously wounded in the face. As
a rule, the puma is a cowardly animal, and is frequently killed by
the Indians with a <i>bolas</i>.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p class="caption">THE HUEMUL DOE WHICH TOUCHED THE AUTHOR. PHOTOGRAPHED WITH SMALL CAMERA
AS SHE RETIRED</p>
</div>

<p>Although, during the whole of our journey, we were constantly
coming upon evidences of the presence of pumas round and about
our camps, it was not until we had entered the Cordillera that
they actually reconnoitred the camp. In a forest near Lake
Argentino, one moonlight night, two pumas circled round our
camp, and for upwards of half an hour kept uttering their peculiar
cry. Pumas often stampeded our horses and left plain tracks
near the camp, but in spite of this they killed no animal, not even
a dog, belonging to us.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<p>Puma cubs in captivity become very tame. One settler
whom I met had two cubs about a year old. They were attached
to their new home, and though they would follow a horse for
two hundred yards or so, they invariably returned after a short
distance to the shanty of their owner. Another puma cub had been
kept by Mr. Cattle at Lake Argentino. This cub was wont to
fight battles royal with the hounds, but in the cold of winter would
lie among them for warmth. All these cubs were those of <i>Felis
concolor puma</i>. So long as they were well fed they were docile,
but when hungry their fierce nature reasserted itself. Mr. Cattle
had finally to shoot the cub that belonged to him. Mr. Waring,
however, still had his at the time of my departure. I heard these
two killed a colt in the month of May</p>

<p>The study of the Cordillera wolf (<i>Canis magellanicus</i>) from the
present point of view is exceptionally interesting. To this animal
man is practically unknown, and it manifested the most utter fearlessness,
when brought into contact with human beings, during our
expedition. This wolf will advance within five or six yards
of a man in open daylight; it will walk over him when asleep
in camp. They haunted our camps about Lake Buenos Aires,
lurking about all the night through and eating everything that
came within their reach; then, instead of departing when daylight
came, they usually remained crouching near by, and put in
an appearance during breakfast-time with an absolute disregard
or ignorance of probable danger from the neighbourhood of man.</p>

<p>On the River Fenix one of these wolves came into Rosy
Camp during the night, stole a duck and a goose, and further
gnawed my rifle-slings within a few feet of where I was sleeping.
We only discovered our loss at dawn, and while we were still
discussing it, I perceived the animal itself lying under a bush
close at hand calmly watching us. Deprived of breakfast, I
had no thought of mercy, and shot her with a Mauser. She was
an old female. That night her mate paid us a visit, and
frightened the horses, who seem to fear the large Cordillera wolf
almost as much as the puma. I was rather crippled at the time
with an injury to my knee, and was sitting by the fire. I happened
to look up and caught sight of the wolf standing within a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
yards of me. He quietly returned my look but made no movement
to run away. In a moment or two I got up and limped
across to fetch my gun, the wolf watching me with interest, but
without the smallest sign of apprehension. As a matter of fact,
he came a few steps nearer to me, still gazing at me fixedly.
He also joined the majority in a very short space of time. We
could not afford to have such desperate thieves about our camp.
At another place in the same neighbourhood a wolf, coming in
to investigate our camp, was attacked by my big deerhound
Tom. The wolf made no attempt to escape but met his foe
with a fearful bite, and in the end we had to go to Tom's assistance
before the wolf could be killed.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_333" id="i_333"></a>
<img src="images/i_333.jpg" width="550" height="351" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Camp Thieves</span><br />
	<span class="s08"><i>Photochromogravure, Lyons &amp; London.</i></span></p>
</div>

<p>From these instances it will be seen that the Cordillera wolf
has absolutely no fear of man. The pampa fox shares this
characteristic, but possesses it in a much less prominent degree.
When I have been chasing one of these latter the animal has in
more than one case stopped to regard me steadfastly, not with the
timid curiosity of the huemul but with a fearless stare. Yet these
foxes are hunted for their pelts. One evening I fired at a pampa
fox and missed him. He retired at a slow lollop while I pursued
him. When a couple of hundred yards had been covered, he halted,
chose a bush, deliberately lay down and waited for me, his muzzle
sunk upon his paws. I picked up a handful of gravel and tossed it
at him. He rose, snarled, looked at me for a moment, and then
walked slowly off.</p>

<p>The data given above suffice to show that different animals
assume very various attitudes with regard to man on first introduction
to knowledge of him. Not only this, but animals of the
same species behave variously under these circumstances. My
experience of Patagonian wild animals goes to prove that those
to whom we were the first human visitors regarded us with
extreme curiosity, and though in some cases there was a show of
timidity, it was not to be confounded with any apprehension of
violence at our hands.</p>

<p>To sum up the relative confidingness of the animals I met with,
I propose to take the distance within which they will allow man to
approach as a sort of scale:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span></p>

<p>Guanaco. The evidence is contradictory, but it may be taken
that these animals will allow a man to proceed <i>towards</i> them to
within eighty yards; at any rate, in most cases. But if a man
remain stationary, they will be inclined to approach him a little
nearer.</p>

<p>Huemules will allow man to approach within fifteen yards. If
he remain perfectly still, they will go almost up to him.</p>

<p>Puma (<i>Felis concolor puma</i>). If unacquainted with man, will
occasionally attack him.</p>

<p>Cordillera wolf. Utterly fearless of man. Will, if approached
too closely, show signs of taking the offensive. Will stand over
his kill until the human intruder is within a foot or so.</p>

<p>Pampa fox. Will allow approach to within twenty yards.</p>

<p>I have already described the attitude of all these animals
towards man in the more settled districts, with the one exception
of the Cordillera wolf. Concerning this animal no data, so far as I
know, exists, as his range does not, in my experience&mdash;I am here
open to correction&mdash;extend beyond the foothills of the Cordillera.</p>

<p>The whole of my personal knowledge as to the behaviour of
animals toward man on first meeting with him leads me to believe
that none but extremely broad rules can be laid down on the subject.
It would be very difficult to prophesy the precise attitude
likely to be adopted by any individual animal under this condition,
for the evidence concerning animals of the same species varies so
largely. I am, therefore, driven to believe that the conduct of
any given animal depends on its own special turn of character;
that it is, in fact, a matter of individual temperament. In the case
of a group of animals, the note of the behaviour of the whole group
would be given by either the leader of the herd, or would depend
on the first instinctive action of that one of the group which was
the first to perceive the strange object.</p>

<p>But, having stated the evidence which I gathered, it will be
better to leave others to draw their own conclusions.

</p>

<p>In commencing this chapter I may remark that, as far as English
publications are concerned, I have found nothing bearing on the
zoology of South-eastern Patagonia of later date than the book of
Captain Musters, published in 1871, and no work whatever dealing
with the mammals of the Cordillera.</p>

<p>Captain Musters traversed the country with a tribe of Tehuelche
Indians, and only at one point touched the Cordillera. His book
is essentially a book treating of these interesting Indians, and he
does little more than refer now and then to the zoology of the land
through which he passed.</p>

<p>Every one is, of course, familiar with the volumes to which the
voyages of the <i>Adventure</i> and the <i>Beagle</i> gave rise, but it must
be remembered that the most westerly point attained by the boat-party
from the <i>Beagle</i>, which ascended the Santa Cruz River, was
Mystery Plain. In no English work whatever has any mention
been made of the huemul (<i>Xenelaphus bisulcus</i>), a deer peculiar to
the Southern Cordillera, nor have we any account of the habits of
the puma, or, I should rather say, the pumas of Patagonia.
During the time we spent in Patagonia we covered a considerable
portion of the country, and passed some five or six months within
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
the Cordillera, or in their immediate neighbourhood, so that we
had ample opportunity for making some interesting observations.</p>

<p>To begin with, I should like to say a few words concerning
the distribution, broadly speaking, of the principal mammals of
Patagonia.</p>

<p>Patagonia is divided practically into sections by its eastward-flowing
rivers. To-day the jaguar (<i>Felis onca</i>) does not, I am
informed, range south of the River Colorado, although specimens
were killed in the vicinity of the River Negro fifteen years ago.
The River Deseado forms the southern limit of the distribution of
the Patagonian cavy (<i>Dolichotis patagonica</i>). The armadillo
(<i>Dasypus minutus</i>) is never found south of the River Santa Cruz.
During four months which I spent south of that river I did not
see one, but when for three days we crossed to the north bank we
met with four and killed one. <i>Dasypus minutus</i> is very common
in the neighbourhood of Bahia Camerones. The range of the
huemul (<i>Xenelaphus bisulcus</i>) is confined to the Cordillera or their
close proximity, according to my experience, while <i>Felis concolor
puma</i>, and the guanaco may be said to cover the entire country
as regards the plains, and I have seen the animals or their traces
in various parts of the Cordillera.</p>

<p>So much for general distribution.</p>

<p>1. Huemul (<i>Xenelaphus bisulcus</i>).</p>

<p>(<i>Huemul</i> or <i>Guemal</i> of the Argentines and Chilians; <i>Ciervo</i> of
the Gauchos of Southern Patagonia; <i>Shóan</i> of the Tehuelches.)</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Lake Buenos Aires this beautiful
deer first came under my observation. On the south side of the
River de los Antiguos I saw a buck (which I shot), two does and
a pricket. I was told by my Gaucho, Humphrey Jones, that the
huemul is found in the forests as far north as the Welsh colony of
The 16th October, about lat. 43°; on the south its range extends to
the Straits of Magellan. The easterly limit of their present habitat
may be said to be the foothills of the Andes. Dr. F. P. Moreno,
however, states that these animals have been seen in the hills in
the vicinity of Port Desire, on the Atlantic Coast: I do not think
that they are any longer to be found there. As far as my personal
observations go, I never came across a specimen farther east than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
a couple of miles from the shore of Lake Buenos Aires upon its
north-eastern side. The Indians said that these deer were at one
time more numerous in that region.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_339" id="i_339"></a>

<p class="caption">BEST HEAD OF HUEMUL (<i>XENELAPHUS BISULCUS</i>) SHOT BY THE AUTHOR. SIDE VIEW<br />
	<span class="s08">(<i>Photo by W. H. Brigden, Horsham</i>)</span></p>
</div>

<p>During the summer the huemules leave the lower grounds,
where the mosquitoes trouble them, and travel up to the snow-line
of the Cordillera and even beyond it. At this season I never saw
a large herd, but in the winter Mr. Cattle, a pioneer living near
Lake Argentino, informed me that he had seen a large herd of
over a hundred strong that visited the lake. In the warmer
weather I noticed them usually in small parties of two or three,
seldom more.</p>

<p>These animals are in the habit of wandering outside the forests
in the evening and forenoon, but in the afternoon they generally
retire to their shelter, where they often lie down. I have found
them inhabiting the margins of the dense forests upon the slopes
of the Cordillera which border the lakes. They are excellent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
swimmers, and cross the broad arms of Lake Argentino without
hesitation.</p>

<p>In December the huemules which I shot were shedding their
winter coat, and I noticed the bucks were farther advanced in this
matter than the does. There were a few scraps of velvet clinging
to the horns of one of the bucks which I shot on December 9,
1901. It is curious to note that the Indians, on seeing my reindeer-skin
sleeping-bag, triumphantly identified it as being made of
the pelt of the huemul!</p>

<p>The best head that I secured carried five points. Mr. Von
Plaaten Hallermund, of the Argentine Boundary Commission, told
me he had seen a huemul's head carrying eight points in the neighbourhood
of Lake San Martin. One of my <i>peones</i>, Bernardo
Hähansen, who had penetrated into the same district, said he had
also seen an eight-pointer. Mr. Cattle and his companions shot
two bucks, both of which were four-pointers.</p>

<p>Save for the attacks of pumas, the huemul lives pretty well undisturbed
in his fastnesses. The Indians do not hunt them, as in
the forest-land horses and <i>boleadores</i> are comparatively useless.
They do occasionally kill a few of these deer, however, which may
have strayed to the foothills or to the shores of the lakes.</p>

<p>Huemules are, in general, very confiding, for their range is
confined for the most part to districts where they have little chance
of making acquaintance with the human race. But near the colony
of The 16th October, Jones told me that they had become very
wary and difficult of access, as was to be expected in a region where
they are constantly hunted. In the more unpenetrated parts the
buck is very courageous in the rutting season, and has been known
to make some show of attacking man. On open ground, in my
own experience, they manifested wonderfully little timidity, and
would wait for the approach of man, but inside the forests they
invariably dashed away on catching a glimpse of one of our party.
If, however, you have a dog with you, they will in all cases take to
flight.</p>

<p>In the preceding chapter I have given various illustrations of
the natural tameness of the huemul.</p>

<p>When it has observed something unusual in its surroundings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
this deer will remain watching, and without moving, for a great
length of time. On one occasion I saw near Lake Argentino a
buck and doe about a quarter of a mile away. I was lying under
a bush watching some wild cattle, a herd of which were above me
against the snow-line, and the huemules stood and watched me for
nearly an hour. They were some ten yards from each other.
Presently the cattle moved, and I followed them upwards. I
returned unsuccessful in the evening to the spot, not having fired a
shot, and found the two deer still watching my horse, which was
tied up on the shore of the lake.</p>

<p>On one or two occasions when I have fired at a huemul
the others of the herd have run towards the noise. Once this
happened when I was in full sight of the animals.</p>

<p>Musters, in his travels through Patagonia, mentions a "red"
deer. Of this I could find no trace, so that in all probability he
alluded to the huemul under that name; the reddish tinge of the
huemul's hair lends likelihood to this suggestion.</p>

<p>No. 2. Puma (<i>Felis concolor puma</i>).</p>

<p>(<i>Leon</i> of the Argentines; <i>Gol</i> of the Tehuelches.)</p>

<p>This is the silver-grey variety of puma most commonly met
with in Patagonia. The distribution of this animal extends over
the entire country. It is to be found in the Cordillera as on the
pampas. I came upon tracks of this animal at the end of the
north-west fjord of Lake Argentino about long. 73° 14´, and I also
saw a puma at the south-western extremity of that lake.</p>

<p>Evidence of their existence accompanied the whole itinerary of
the expedition throughout the entire route it covered. The number
of pumas in Patagonia is very great, more so than any zoologist
has yet given an idea of. During one winter two pioneers killed
seventy-three near Lake Argentino. Near San Julian immense
numbers are yearly destroyed, but lately, owing to the advent of
settlers, they are becoming less numerous. At Bahia Camerones,
on the farm of Mr. Greenshields, fourteen pumas were killed
during the winter of 1900.</p>

<p>A female killed near Santa Cruz measured 6 ft. 10 in., and a
male killed near Lake Argentino 8 ft. 1 in.</p>

<p>The puma can easily be galloped down, as it rarely runs more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
than 300 yards or a quarter of a mile when pursued on horseback.
It invariably stands at bay with its back to a bush or a rock.</p>

<p>In strong contradistinction to the habit of the <i>Felis onca</i>
(jaguar), <i>F. c. puma</i>, when hunting, kills a number of animals from a
flock or herd. To one only of these kills, however, does it return,
and it always makes some pretence of burying the victim singled
out for its meal, throwing upon the body in many cases merely a
small bunch of thorns. This custom of the puma is frequently
taken advantage of by the shepherds, who poison the chosen
carcass. The puma, ninety times out of a hundred, makes its first
meal upon the entrails of the victim or upon the thigh inside of the
groin.</p>

<p>The destruction wrought by pumas upon flocks of sheep is
immense. One animal killed upwards of 100 head from among a
single flock. One night alone its total amounted to fourteen.
Another point in connection with the predatory habits of the puma
is that it will travel a long distance, even as much as ten or twelve
miles, after killing.</p>

<p>Its method of attack, judging from an examination of its victims,
appears to be to spring upon the shoulders of its quarry and to
break its neck. Cases are reported of pumas attacking horses, but
no instance of this came under my own notice. They generally
select a stormy and tempestuous night during which to make their
depredations. It is rather curious, as occasionally happens, to see
a herd of cows with their calves take up the trail of a puma with a
great deal of lowing and fuss, but they do not follow it for any
distance.</p>

<p>Darwin writes that the puma is a very silent animal, uttering
no cry even when wounded, and only rarely during the breeding
season. One moonlight night, in a forest by Lake Argentino, a
couple of pumas came out of the dark and began to walk round
and round the camp, and continued to do so for more than an hour,
all the time keeping up their peculiar cry. On no other occasion&mdash;though,
as I have said, pumas or rather the evidences of their
presence, accompanied us through our long journeys&mdash;did I hear
them break silence.</p>

</div>

<p>Pumas are more often destroyed in winter, when the snow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
lies on the ground, and their tracks can be followed to their hiding-places;
otherwise they are so marvellously expert in concealing
themselves that it is often impossible to find their lair.</p>

<p>Authentic instances of pumas having attacked man are few;
but some have certainly occurred.</p>

<p>No. 3. Pearson's Puma (<i>Felis concolor pearsoni</i>).</p>

<p>On my return from Patagonia I brought with me a puma-skin,
which seemed to me to differ in some essential respects from any
known species. Mr. J. G. Millais, on examining the skin, agreed
with me, and pointed out that it possessed several characteristics
which do not occur in <i>Felis concolor puma</i>. I took the skin to the
Natural History Museum, where Mr. Oldfield Thomas came to the
conclusion that the animal was a sub-species of <i>F. c. puma</i>, and
named it <i>Felis concolor pearsoni</i>.</p>

<p>The chief points of difference between the two species are as
follows: The very different general colour, <i>F. c. pearsoni</i> being
reddish-fawn instead of silver-grey. The proportionately very
short tail; light instead of dark colour on the backs of the ears,
which are, moreover, sharply pointed in the case of the new sub-species,
and there is an absence of the dark markings round the
digital pads which distinguishes <i>Felis concolor puma</i>.</p>

<p>Several Gauchos, settlers and Indians informed me that there
were two kinds of pumas in Patagonia, one being very common,
silver-grey in colour and cowardly; the other they described as
rare, much fiercer, of a reddish colour, and somewhat smaller than
the common grey species. Amongst the seventy-three pumas
killed by the English pioneers near Lake Argentino, one, Mr.
Cattle told me, differed very much from the ordinary puma, and
judging from the description he gave of it, I have no hesitation in
concluding that it was a specimen of <i>Felis concolor pearsoni</i>.</p>

<p>No. 4. Guanaco (<i>Lama huanachus</i>).</p>

<p>(<i>Guanaco</i> of settlers, Argentines and Chilians; <i>Rou</i> of the
Tehuelches.)</p>

<p>During the whole course of our travels in Patagonia (save
when in the forests) a day rarely passed without our seeing
guanacos. They may be met within a few hours' ride of any
settlement. The range of the guanaco extends all over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
plains of Patagonia. In my experience they were most numerous
in the <i>Cañadon</i> Davis, in the neighbourhood of Bahia Camerones,
and on the high basaltic tablelands to the south of Lake Buenos
Aires. At the base
of the Cordillera and
in some of the river-valleys
under the
edge of the mountains,
the range of
the guanaco crosses
that of the huemul.
I do not think,
however, that the
guanacos ever enter
the forest, although
I have seen them in
the open patches
amongst the lower
wooded parts of the Cordillera. As the seasons change they move
from higher to lower ground, but these migrations are limited, and
a white guanaco has been observed year after year in the same
neighbourhood. During the time I spent at Lake Argentino&mdash;from
February 1 to May 15&mdash;I saw but few of these animals, for
at that season all the herds migrate to the high pampa. A herd
four or five hundred strong inhabited the higher plateaus of
Mount Frias.</p>

<p class="caption">HEAD OF GUANACO</p>
</div>

<p>FitzRoy, in his "Voyages of the <i>Adventure</i> and the <i>Beagle</i>,"
writes, "Do the guanacos approach the river to drink when
they are dying? or are the bones and remains of animals eaten
by lions or by Indians? or are they washed together by floods?
Certain it is that they are remarkably numerous near the banks of
the river (Santa Cruz), but not so elsewhere." It is true that,
although one comes upon skeletons of these animals upon the
pampas, they are not crowded together as they are in the
<i>cañadones</i> of the rivers or by the lakes near water. At the edge
of a lagoon at the eastern end of Mystery Plain I saw a great
number of skeletons in one place, possibly the very ones noted by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
FitzRoy. They extended in a wide track down the hillside and to
the edge of the water. At Lake Viedma the margins of the
lake, near the outflow of the Leona, were covered with their skins
and bones. The meaning of this I gathered from Mr. Ernest
Cattle. He told me that in the winter of 1899 enormous numbers
of guanaco sought Lake Argentino, and died of starvation upon
its shores. In the severities of winter they seek drinking-places,
where there are large masses of water likely to be unfrozen.
The few last winters in Patagonia have been so severe as to
work great havoc among the herds of guanaco.</p>

<p>At nightfall guanacos gather into close order, a large herd collecting
in a small radius. They seem to choose open spaces in
which to pass the hours of darkness. In moments of danger also
they pack together densely. At the sound of a shot, the outlying
members of a herd will close up and sway their long necks almost
to the ground in unison. I see that Darwin says that guanaco are
"generally very wild and wary." In places where they are hunted
by the Indians this is undoubtedly the case, but on this point no
law can be laid down. In some districts the guanaco is very difficult
of approach, in others extremely easy. The evidence that I
can adduce concerning this point I have given at length in another
chapter. Their instinct of curiosity is very largely developed.
During our wanderings I studied the habits of the guanaco with
ever-increasing interest. In cold weather they become extraordinarily
tame, and will permit a man to walk among them as a
shepherd walks among his sheep.</p>

<p>The young are brought forth in the months of October,
November and the early part of December. In Southern Patagonia
some are born as late as the end of December. During
the period of copulation the bucks fight a good deal. I never
shot an old buck which was not seamed and scarred with the
marks of these contests. When fighting they give vent to loud
squeals of rage, they strike with their forefeet and bite savagely,
mostly at the neck of the antagonist. The marks of these bites
are often deep and long. The skin of the neck is luckily very
thick, so little harm is done. As has been noted before, the
guanacos drop all their dung in one spot, and near these spots
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
their wallows are ordinarily to be found. I saw an old buck spend
a long time over his toilette while his wives looked on and waited.
He would spend nearly half an hour on his back with his legs in
the air, at intervals standing up to neigh and then rolling again.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_348" id="i_348"></a>
<img src="images/i_348.jpg" width="456" height="318" alt="" />
<p class="caption">GUANACO CHICO (CAPTURED WITH LASSOO)</p>
</div>

<p>A guanaco descending a hillside is a truly wonderful sight.
He proceeds in a succession of bounds, on landing from each
of which he dips his head almost to touch his forefeet. The
young guanaco keeps up with his elders over bad ground in an
extraordinary way.</p>

<p>The power of affection in guanacos towards their young did not
appear to me to be very strong. From time to time I had to shoot
a young one for food. Out of nine instances which I find in my
diary, only twice did the mother halt in her flight to see what had
happened to her offspring. On both occasions she stopped within
two hundred and fifty yards and stared towards me. If dogs
enter into the chase the mother deserts to a greater distance.
One day, when I with the dogs had killed a young guanaco, I left
it lying and rode away with the dogs. Returning alone, I took up
my quarters in the heart of a bush, from whence I observed
the herd to which the mother belonged. They did not return nearer
than a quarter of a mile to the spot. On another occasion when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
I shot a young guanaco and concealed myself for the same reason,
the whole herd came back and, mounting an eminence in the neighbourhood,
scanned the scene of the disaster. They did not, however,
venture near the place where the quarry was lying. Curiously
enough, wild cattle, though much more difficult of approach than
guanaco, often come back in the night lowing and bellowing to
visit the spot where a herd-mate has been killed, but before dawn
they invariably leave that part of the forest.</p>

<p>The young guanaco is an easy quarry. We caught a considerable
number of them for food with the aid of the hounds.</p>

<p>On one occasion a young one was simply headed off from the
herd, its portrait taken, and then it was set free again.</p>

<p>No. 5. Patagonian cavy (<i>Dolichotis patagonica</i>).</p>

<p>(Called "cavy" or "hare" indiscriminately by the English
residents; <i>liebre</i> by the Argentines and Chilians; <i>Paahi</i> by the
Tehuelches.)</p>

<p>The River Deseado forms the southern limit of the distribution
of the Patagonian cavy. In 1833 Darwin writes concerning this
animal, "They are found as far north as the Sierra Tapalguen
(lat. 37° 30´), and their southern limit is between Port Desire and
San Julian, where there is no change in the nature of the country."
As far as my experience goes, I never observed a cavy after
October 23, upon which day I counted fourteen upon the pampa
between Lake Musters and the settlement of Colohuapi. The
residents of Colohuapi informed me that the place formed the
southern limit of the distribution of the cavy. It is, of course,
impossible to lay down an exact line, but I think it safe to say that
the range of the cavy does not extend south of the 46th parallel.
This limit is the more remarkable inasmuch as the country south
of lat. 46° does not in any way materially differ from that over
which the cavy is commonly to be met with. One most often finds
these animals on patches of dry mud. They are comparatively easy
to stalk, as easy as an English rabbit. The best method of shooting
them is, of course, with the rifle, though occasionally you may start
them from a thicket and shoot them as you would an English hare
with a shot-gun. They generally weigh between 18 lb. and 25 lb.,
though I heard of one which I was assured weighed 31 lb.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>

<p>The cavy will often lead the hounds a good chase, especially
where the ground is broken, in such places frequently making its
escape.</p>

<p>After being frightened it very soon makes its reappearance,
and when it actually takes to flight it rarely goes more than a
hundred yards before it turns to see whether it is an object of
pursuit. This is only the case when man alone is the pursuer;
when dogs are present there is no time to be lost in speculation of
any kind.</p>

<p>No. 6. Armadillo (<i>Dasypus minutus</i>).</p>

<p>(<i>Pichy</i> of the Argentines and Chilians; <i>Ano</i> of the
Tehuelches.)</p>

<p>This animal is never found south of the River Santa Cruz.
During the four months I spent south of that river I did not see
one, but when for three days we crossed to the north bank we
met with four and killed one, as I have before mentioned. <i>Dasypus
minutus</i> is very common in the vicinity of Bahia Camerones. I
saw no specimen in the forests of the Andes, but near Lake Buenos
Aires and Lake Viedma we found them about the foothills.</p>

<p>No. 7. The Grey or Pampa Fox; <i>Zorro</i> of the Argentines;
<i>Paltñ</i> of the Tehuelches.</p>

<p>To the east of the Andes, the pampa fox is to be met with
practically everywhere. There are two varieties of foxes upon
the pampa. The common pampa variety is a most inveterate
thief, and causes endless trouble to travellers by eating all and
anything that the wind may blow down from the bushes, upon
which one's belongings are generally hung by way of guarding
against their depredations. If a horse is <i>sogaed</i> out with a
<i>cabresto</i> of hide, the foxes will very often gnaw through the
<i>cabresto</i> and set the horse free. This trick has cost the life of
more than one Gaucho, who, travelling alone upon the pampa, in
some district hundreds of miles away from human habitations,
has been left quite helpless without his horse, unable to use his
<i>bolas</i> with effect on foot, and so has starved to death.</p>

<p>In my experience the range of the grey fox seems to cease at
the foothills of the Cordillera, where the Magellan wolf (<i>Canis magellanicus</i>)
is to be found. Of course, in making this statement I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
open to correction. I can merely state that, during the time I spent
at Lake Buenos Aires and Lake Argentino, I never saw a pampa
fox, although evidences of their presence in the way of tracks were
frequent, upon the north shore of the former lake. Yet directly
one ascended the range of the hills towards the River Fenix, pampa
foxes were to be seen. On the top of Mount Frias I saw a pampa
fox in the snow. I never came upon the pampa fox in the forests
which grow upon the slopes of the Cordillera.</p>

<p>The fearlessness of the grey pampa fox is remarkable, even in
districts where it is chased by the Indians and their dogs. The
pelts are much used for making <i>capas</i> or fur cloaks. During the
early part of January 1901, upon the pampa outside the Cordillera,
we continually came upon half-grown pampa foxes in twos and
threes. Until they saw the dogs they never took to flight.</p>

<p>No. 8. Cordillera Wolf (<i>Canis magellanicus</i>).</p>

<p>This is the animal locally known as the Cordillera fox. I have
elsewhere touched upon its strongest characteristic of courage,
and also the dread it inspires among horses. It is, of course, a
much larger animal than the pampa fox, which latter can wander
about among the troop without causing any disturbance. A single
Cordillera wolf will attack young huemules as well as the young of
the guanaco. Although found in the forest, this animal also
frequents the plains at the foothills of the Cordillera. Personally
I never observed it farther east than the River Fenix. In the one
case that came under my observation, when sheep had been
brought within its range, its depredations among them were
considerable.</p>

<p>The measurements which I made of three of these animals
were as follows: Female killed at the River Fenix, Lake Buenos
Aires, thirty-nine inches; dog-wolf killed at the same place, forty-one
inches; dog-wolf killed at the Lake Argentino, forty-one
inches. These measurements were taken from the teeth to the
end of the tail directly after the shooting of the animals.</p>

<p>When with young the Cordillera wolf, indeed I may say the
Cordillera wolves, both male and female, will run growling towards
man if he attempts to approach their litter. As far as could be
judged from an examination of the lair of one, their bill of fare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
is very varied. There were the remains of many kinds of birds,
as well as the bones of the young of guanaco and huemul.</p>

<p>There is another form of the wolf which I think should perhaps
be considered as a sub-species under the name of <i>Canis montanus</i>.
Its range is at present undefined. It is a red variety and lacks the
dark markings of <i>Canis magellanicus</i>. I hope shortly to have a
series of skins of this type. At present my readers can refer
to the coloured plate "Camp Thieves," and the photograph on this
page. Its general habits seem to be identical with those of <i>Canis
magellanicus</i>.</p>

<p>No. 9. Skunk (<i>Conepatus patagonicus</i>).</p>

<p>(<i>Zorino</i> of the Argentines; <i>wikster</i> of the Tehuelches.)</p>

<p>The skunk is to be met with throughout the whole country, but
we saw perhaps more specimens of this animal in the neighbourhood
of Bahia Camerones than elsewhere. I have also observed it within
ten miles of the foot of the Cordillera. The skins are much prized
by the Indians for the making of <i>capas</i>.</p>

<p>Besides the animals enumerated above, an otter is common in
most of the rivers, but as all the skins I collected have not arrived
at the moment of writing, I will hold over any description of this
animal until a later date.</p>

</p>

<p>"An important river flows into the end of the north fjord (of Lake
Argentino) with clear waters&mdash;a sure sign that it proceeds from
another great lake still unknown."</p>

<p>In these words, taken from the <i>Journal of the Royal Geographical
Society</i> for September 1899, under the head of
"Explorations in Patagonia," by Dr. Moreno, you have the idea
which was the spring of all our efforts in bringing down the launch
to Lake Argentino and the aim of the subsequent voyages made
in her.</p>

<p>The opening to the north passage or fjord is locally known as
Hellgate, so called on account of the rough weather which usually
prevails there. The spot is the opening of a long winding channel
that, running up between beetling cliffs and forested mountain-sides
as it were into the heart of the Andes, becomes simply a vast
funnel through which the winds and storms discharge themselves
upon the lake at all times and seasons. I cannot give a better
description of Lake Argentino than by using the following extract
from Dr. Moreno's account:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span></p>

<p>"Lake Argentino ... extends sixty miles to the west; and
the fjords of the extreme west divide into three arms, which receive
the waters of large glaciers from Mount Stokes up to the vicinity
of Lake Viedma. An important river flows into the end of the
north fjord, with clear waters&mdash;a sure sign that it proceeds from
another great lake still unknown. The western end is closed by
the main chain of the Cordillera with its glaciers, which cross to
the Pacific fjords of Peel Inlet and St. Andrew's Sound, and one
can distinguish peaks more than 10,000 feet, as Mount Agassiz
(10,597 feet)."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_354" id="i_354"></a>
<img src="images/i_354.jpg" width="550" height="355" alt="" />
<p class="caption">HELLGATE</p>
</div>

<p>On March 11, having mended the launch to the best of our
ability, we intended to make a start from Cow Monte Harbour.
As we rode down from Cattle's, driving my troop of horses before
us, the calm weather which had attended the period of repairs
broke up and a strong wind began to blow out of the south-west.
A start was, therefore, rendered impossible. We accordingly
camped beside the launch, to be ready for an early departure. All
night long the wind held, and the sheepskins in the after-hatch,
where I was sleeping, took in water. It needed little waking,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
therefore, to get me out in the morning. The false dawn was
still lingering in the sky when the wind fell and we were off in
double quick time, heading in a northerly direction, and steering
by a clump of <i>Leña dura</i> bushes on a promontory, behind which
lay Hellgate.</p>

<p>The swell of the previous night was yet big upon the water,
and the launch crawled over it at about three knots. The entrance
to Hellgate is possibly one of the most menacing and sinister-looking
spots in South America. The great grooved cliffs tower
over the yeasty cauldron of water, and down the channel between
them, as I have said, the wind hurtles as through a funnel. On
this particular morning a squall had darkened the great and houseless
unknown beyond. Several icebergs were huddled together,
stranded upon the shallows of the eastern shore.</p>

<p>After running through the black throat of Hellgate we put
in, beneath a big rock, in order to take shelter from the squall
that was fast coming down upon us. We had started on a <i>maté</i>,
and so, while we waited, a roast was got under way. As we were
eating, the squall that had brooded so ominously in the west broke
over the lake, and after raging for a few minutes passed with a
shiver that you could follow with the eye, till it lost itself in the
distance of the early morning waters. Then the sun glowed out
suddenly, as if some gigantic power had lifted an extinguisher
from its glory. The farther and middle distances were peopled
with snow-peaks, rising in minarets above their girdles of dark
forest, which last stretched downwards until they lipped the
black water at the mountain bases. For a moment after the
outburst of radiance the water alone remained black and angry,
and then the squall flicked away its skirts and passed from
view, leaving a picture of cold and austere purity extending to the
rim of sight. In words I cannot give you any reflection of the
scene, and no photograph could ever do more than reproduce its
outlines, and yet I suppose few human eyes will ever look upon it.</p>

<p>To describe the kaleidoscope of colours and the scenery through
which we passed in that north-west passage of Lake Argentino
would merely leave me a beggar in adjectives. Suffice it to say
that for that day at least the mist and gloom of the clouds shared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
short watches with the gold and white of flying sunshine. For
the first time in our experience of her the launch played us no
tricks, and our progress went on at a steady three knots. Soon a
gigantic glacier showed in the channel, seeming to block all farther
advance. The Fjord looked full of icebergs; there must have
been three thousand of them lying, an inanimate fleet, in their
mountain-bound harbour of wind and mist.</p>

<p>A nasty squall caught us as we dodged among the ice, the
smallest ripple set us gripping our frail craft, and I am afraid that
a moderate sea would have drowned her fires and sent us to
explore downwards rather than onwards. Indeed, our entire life
on the launch was one long history of danger-dodging. I do not
give the details, because some of the same sort have already been
written, and repetition is needless. I grant there was more risk
in taking the launch and using her in such waters than, perhaps,
wisdom would have approved. Without her, however, we could
have had no chance of exploring the North Fjord and solving the
mystery of the "river with clear waters." Moreover, those who
accompanied me went of their own free will, and I must here
record my gratitude to Mr. Cattle, who willingly risked his life on
our voyages in the launch, and also to Burbury&mdash;who accompanied
me on my first journey&mdash;as well as to Bernardo, who was with me
throughout the whole of my Lake Argentino experiences. Wherever
I may travel in the future, I can wish for no better companions.</p>

<p class="caption">THE NORTH FIORD</p>
</div>

<p>Bernardo, the most willing of men, kept our nerves in a state
of less than pleasurable excitement. He drove the launch, when
I took my eye off him, with 145 lb. of steam in her worn-out boiler&mdash;her
safety-limit at the best of times had been 130 lb. On shore he
succeeded in firing off my jungle-gun by mistake, narrowly missing
killing himself at close quarters and myself at some few feet distance.
But even after this involuntary attempt at manslaughter one could
not be angry with him, he was so genuinely sorry, yet one could
not help foreseeing that he was eminently likely to do something
of the sort again. He was, to use slang, such a "decent chap," he
never grumbled when he had nothing to eat, or a bout of bitter cold
labour when we were obliged to turn out in the night to get up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
anchor or do some other job. He was also a glutton of the first
water for work, but we were all persuaded that he would end by
slaying us, in which case I have not the slightest doubt he would
have said to me as we were being ferried across the Styx, "By
good, Mr. Preechard, I
am sorry, the old launch
she bust up!" From looking
on the launch, as he
did at first, with considerable
awe and respect,
familiarity with her bred
contempt, and all her parts
lost their novelty to him,
save the whistle. When
he blew that his face
would betoken the intensest
satisfaction. In many ways the placid Swede caused us
much amusement.</p>

<p class="caption">BEYOND MAN'S FOOTSTEPS</p>
</div>

<p>One of the most singular things to be observed during that
day was the absence of life in the forest which bordered the shore.
It was strange to sail along under the vast masses of vegetation
and rarely to see or hear any sign of life. On March 12 we continued
our advance, and finding that the Fjord here split up into
three or four channels, we chose the most westward of them. Our
progress was very slow owing to the west wind having packed the
ice. In the evening we made our camp among some dead trees
upon the margin of the water, and I wandered off into the thickets,
where I saw a Cordillera wolf. I picked up a stone and threw it
at him, but this had no effect until I hit him with a small twig,
which made him growl. Finally he took refuge in a bush.</p>

<p>It was while at this camp that we cut for the first time some
<i>Leña dura</i> as firing for the launch. It proved better than califate
and gave at least three times the amount of heat to be had from
<i>roblé</i>-wood. Afterwards, whenever possible, we burned no other
fuel than <i>Leña dura</i>.</p>

<p>The following is from my diary:</p>

<p>"<i>March 21.</i>&mdash;During this trip we have had a collapsible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
canvas boat in tow of the launch, which boat has saved us many a
wetting in boarding and in leaving the launch. We go ashore in
relays, one man remaining on the launch. This evening, while
Cattle, Burbury and I were on the beach wood-cutting and tent-pitching,
I heard Cattle shout, and, looking round, saw, to my disgust,
the canvas boat already some twenty yards out and drifting
quickly away from the beach. The wind had caught her broadside
on, and she was being blown out into the current beyond the calm
of our sheltering promontory. Cattle and I ran down to the
shingle, casting off our clothes as we went. I thought we were in
for a long swim, no pleasant prospect in that ice-cold water among
the floes. But, as luck would have it, there was a little point of
land projecting from the cliff of the promontory, and to this we
made our hurried way, leaving behind us a spoor of shed garments.
We arrived in the nick of time to secure the boat, and Cattle
rowed her round to the beach beyond the camp.</p>

<p>"There is one enormous glacier visible almost due north. It
had evidently been throwing many bergs of late. We called it the
Giant's Glacier. This glacier is marked with double lines of
brown reaching from the clouds right down to the margin of the
water, for all the world like the tracks of the chariot wheels of
some giant. We are now very much in the kingdom of the ice.
Away beyond the immediate foreground of the shores and forests
is spread a panorama of unnamed peaks. The silence is seldom
broken save by the scream of the wind or the crashing fall of some
mass of ice from the glaciers.</p>

<p>"I find my camera has been damaged. This is unfortunate,
but hardly to be wondered at. It is a difficult matter to prevent
mischief when the launch rolls and everything gets adrift, and
one's time is taken up with keeping one's balance, steering, or in
doing the myriad little jobs that crowd one upon the other.
Although the camera reposed in the sheltering care of various
rugs in the after-hatch, the heavy weather defeated all our precautions.
In this difficulty a novel of Miss Marie Corelli's has
been of the utmost assistance, and saved us from the misfortune of
being unable to take photographs. The colonial edition of the
'Master Christian' has a thick red cover, and with the help of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
some flour paste we have succeeded in making the camera light-proof.
Thus I owe a second debt of gratitude to Miss Marie
Corelli, beside the pleasure of reading her book."</p>

<p>The next day broke clear and still, raising our hopes as to our
progress through the ice. I must say that we took our fine blue
weather&mdash;little of it as we were blessed with&mdash;with a hearty
pleasure, and enjoyed it most thoroughly. We might be cold and
wet an hour later, but between the squalls it was not so disagreeable,
and we made the best of the breaks.</p>

<p>It was not long under these favourable circumstances before
we reached the last curve of the channel, and were confronted by
another glacier of considerable size, coming down through a
depression in the midst of a mountain. Below the glacier the
shoulders and base of the mountain were covered with dark forests.
All round under the cliffs was, as I have said, deep water, how
deep I do not know, as we had no means of taking soundings of
such depth.</p>

<p>As there seemed little to be gained by landing at the foot of the
glacier we ran back to the camp of the previous night, where the
harbourage was at any rate somewhat better. While we were
yet ashore, a squall began to grow up in the sky to the west
and came down upon the water in an angry spatter of rain. It
subsided, however, as quickly as it had arisen, so we got afloat
again. Running back through the narrow throat of the channel,
we found that the wind, which had veered several points to the
north, had almost blocked it with a fleet of icebergs, that were
grinding together on the swell of the water. These we managed
to make our way through, and it was with some thankfulness that
we presently reached the farther shore on the east of the main
Fjord. We had no sooner arrived than it began to blow in heavy
gusts, and five minutes after the first of them&mdash;so quickly do the
seas rise upon this lake&mdash;we had to shift our anchorage.</p>

<p>In an hour or two, having in the meantime laid in a good store
of firewood, and the heavy wind being succeeded by a series of cold
showers, we took advantage of the lull and headed up the main
Fjord to the north. But the wind, that had temporarily dropped,
soon resumed its fury, and the launch was hard put to it to keep her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
position, far less to make any headway, and then, as was usual in
moments of need, the pumps ceased working altogether, and
Burbury shouted that no more than ten minutes' steam remained
in the boiler. There was nothing for it but to turn her and to run
for the land. We found, however, small hope of anchorage, for
a bare fifty-foot cliff rose sheer out of the water and so continued
for a long distance ahead. Seeing we were unlikely to discover
a suitable position, we decided to cross the lake, but we had
not gone far when the propeller wheezed into silence. Strong
squalls caught us and made the launch roll and heave. Cattle got
into the canvas boat with the idea of trying to tow her, and
I forward, put out the long oar, which we generally used as one
of the bulwarks&mdash;and we both endeavoured to keep her from
turning broadside on to the waves, in which case she would have
been swamped.</p>

<p>Cattle shortly gave up his attempt to tow her; in the sea then
running such an effort was hopeless. The wind increased. Cattle
came aboard, not without difficulty, and tried rowing with a short
oar. Meantime Burbury was baling water into the boiler with a
cooking-pot. The launch was rolling in a manner which made
rowing a difficult matter. Presently the oar I was using broke off
short and the launch was drifting ominously near to a reef. It was
a race as to whether we should get up steam before we were cast
upon it. We watched the index of the register slowly beginning
to quiver, and when it marked 30 lb. we were not much more
than a score or so of yards from the rocks. This was, however,
enough to enable us to get way on and forge slowly out of
danger.</p>

<p>Our steam did not last much longer than to allow us to find
shelter under the lee of a line of low rocks, which thrust themselves
out and served as a little breakwater in the lake. We remained there
while Burbury again filled the boiler, and, having got up steam, we
made the mouth of a deep inlet which afforded us good harbourage.
Here we landed, and found ourselves upon a peninsula shaped
like a spoon, the handle that connected it with the land being
very narrow. At its upper end it joined the moraine of the great
glacier which I had called Giant's Glacier.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span></p>

<p>As we came in to the beach, three guanacos cantered down
and stared and neighed at us. The sight of these animals
brightened the prospect, as it was pleasant to see living
creatures in what had hitherto seemed to be an empty amphitheatre
of hills. The bay where we had anchored was a shallow
lagoon, into which flowed a little stream that wound away out
of sight through a thin belt of forest over land comparatively
flat. This peninsula carried a light soil and good grass, but
bore the appearance of a spot that the winter would strike with
peculiar severity. The wood was all <i>roblé</i> and <i>Leña dura</i> and
the scrub included califate-bushes, from which last, however, the
purple berries had long since departed, much to our sorrow.
Huemules, guanacos, pumas, and the red fox gave evident signs
of their presence. I observed a pigmy owl (<i>Glaucidium nanum</i>)
and several caranchos. In the evening, when speaking upon the
subject, Cattle informed me that several kinds of fish were to be
found in Lake Argentino. Often as we used to make our meal
of fish and fariña (a compound in the concoction of which for
good or evil Bernardo stood alone), I used to regret my inability
to bring back specimens of the fish from this lake, but I had no
means of preserving them.</p>

<p>"Fish and fariña," indeed, became a standing joke with us.
We might threaten to blow each other up by the agency of the
launch's peculiar engines, and the threats would pass as nothing;
but the expressed intention of any one of us who proposed to go
and catch fish with a view to preparing a meal of "fish and
fariña" soon became too much for the strongest and bravest
among us. As a matter of fact, the fish was far from tempting,
having a muddy flavour and being full of small bones, which
mixed themselves up inextricably with the fariña.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>That night shut down with a gale and much rain. The trees
groaned, and one close to us was blown down. It was with a
very thankful heart that I woke up in the middle of the storm
and reflected upon the glorious safety of our new-found harbour.
Next morning I was awakened sometime in the dusky grey of
dawn because a couple of Chiloe widgeon had come in close to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
the launch, and roasted duck was voted good by the wakeful
Burbury. I sleepily thought the widgeon might have waited, and
after all something scared the ducks and they flew off to a distance
of a couple of hundred yards. My stalk only resulted in my
securing one of the birds.</p>

<p>The ice we had observed earlier in the mouth of the most
westerly channel had by this time completely blocked the opening.
We spent the day wandering about upon the peninsula, and I tried
to get some photographs, but the attempt was rather hopeless in
the mist and rain. Indeed, although advantage was taken of every
lifting of the weather, four pictures were all that this trip allowed
of my completing.</p>

<p>The following day, in spite of bad weather, we made a third
attempt to head up the North Fjord, at the end of which we hoped
to find the "river with clear waters" mentioned by Dr. Moreno,
and at the end of that again the unknown lake. We made two
hours very slow progress, the north-west wind quickly beating up a
troublesome sea. We observed bits of wood travelling faster than
is usual in cases of drift, and now made sure that, could we but
reach the end of the Fjord, we should find the river whose current
we believed to be responsible for the comparatively rapid movement
of the wood.</p>

<p>Our hopes were on this occasion destined to disappointment,
for, in spite of all our efforts, we were unable to go forward or to
make head against the bad weather, which continued for some
days. Besides this, the injector of the launch failed to perform
its office, and as the machinery was badly in need of repairs, and
the cracked plate was letting in water, I thought it better to run
before the wind to Cow Monte Harbour, which was, in fact, our
headquarters, and where such tools as we had were stored. One
point that was always in our favour while making these attempts
to force our way up the North Fjord, lay in the fact that the
prevailing winds from north-west or south-west, as the case might
be, helped rather than hindered us on our return passages.</p>

	<span class="s08">(<i>From a Photograph by the Author</i>)</span></p>
</div>

<p>During this interval, while waiting for a second opportunity
of attempting to gain the extreme end of the North Fjord of
the lake, we arranged to make a short voyage down the South
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
Fjord, or, as it is locally known, to Lake Rica. By doing this,
moreover, we should complete our circumnavigation of Lake
Argentino. Before we left, reliable news came up from the settlements
with some belated Christmas and other papers. We were
very relieved to learn that the Franco-Russian combination was
no more than a camp-scare, nor was Russia advancing on India, as
the last rumours had told us. When one has lost so large a slice
of the general history of the world as we did during the months
passed on our expedition, it is hopeless to imagine one can ever
make up the loss. The events of that period must always remain
blurred and hazy in the mind, only a few ever attaining an accurate
outline. And then how greedy one becomes of news after an
abstinence so prolonged as ours from that daily mental excitement
of civilisation! It is difficult to describe how one grips the strayed
journal or periodical when one has been cut off for months from
these "curses of modern life."</p>

<p>On April 11 we left Cow Monte Harbour and steamed westwards
down the Punta Bandera Channel. In a short time the
pump broke down and we had some trouble in putting it right again.
In defence of our engineering skill I must say that we had against
us the fact that a part of the pump had been taken away for repairs
to Buenos Aires by the Commission. We camped at the mouth
of a river coming down out of Mount Avellaneda. Above us the
bare volcanic summits of the mountains rose starkly out of their
circling forests, that were now turning crimson with the brilliant
colours of autumn. We could also see the great glacier on the
western side of the Canal de los Tempanos. Many deer-tracks
were visible, but we saw only one huemul buck in the edge of the
forest.</p>

<p>We made an early start next day, which luckily was calm, for
the pump gave us a good deal of bother. We proceeded down a
smaller fjord lying under Mount Avellaneda, which took us in a
westerly direction, but presently curved southwards and ended in a
large mountain covered with forest, which I named Mount Millais.
The chief hindrances in these winding passages were the constantly
veering winds that we encountered. Day and night we were
obliged to keep up a constant struggle against them. This was all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
very well during the daylight, but to anchor the launch snugly
and then to be waked by her bumping and straining at her cable
perhaps ten times in the night, and to have to turn out in just
what you happened to have on in the way of sleeping apparel
supplemented only by "the mantle of the night,"&mdash;for there never
was a moment to be lost at these junctures&mdash;was an experience
which quickly became monotonous and wearing to strength and
temper. During this South Fjord trip the launch certainly did
herself proud in this direction; she seldom gave us a couple of
hours' quiet rest, often forcing us to face the biting cold a dozen
times between dark and dawn.</p>

<p>The forests about this part of the lake were immense, and
contained trees and plants unknown in the outer Cordillera or,
rather, I should say, the foothills.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> A bush resembling holly was
conspicuous, fuchsias also abounded.</p>

<p>I quote a short description of this region from my diary:
"The mountains go in and out of the mist, now seen, now lost.
The mist shrouds them at one moment, and the greyness reaches
up to heaven and down to earth&mdash;into a man's soul it often
seems; the next instant there may be gleams of a sad blue sky
shining through the torn banners of the haze, and glaciers assume
a wonderful goblin hue, a pallid violet." There was some sameness
in our days, but the launch kept us alive with anticipation.
She seldom lacked the chance of giving us some surprise.
Often we asked each other, "Will she drown us after all? And
when and where?" A cold death and a deep grave she had it
in her power to give. The one good side to the situation was
that when we landed, as we often did, in a sleety drizzle on a
swampy camp, we forbore to grumble, but were, on the contrary,
filled with a strong thankfulness to have escaped from her even
for a little time.</p>

<p>We had one particularly bad night, when a series of squalls
came down on us, and we spent the greater part of our sleeping-hours
in poling the launch off the shore, but at last the wind got
the better of us and literally hurled her on the beach.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span></p>

<p>How we managed to get her off it is impossible to describe;
we did it somehow. The next morning was still windy, but we
steamed along the Canal de los Tempanos under Mount Buenos
Aires, and there it was that a fire broke out on the launch. This
was an accident we always dreaded, for, having no room elsewhere,
we were obliged to pile the fuel round her engine, with the result
that it occasionally became dangerously heated.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_369" id="i_369"></a>
<img src="images/i_369.jpg" width="550" height="386" alt="" />
<p class="caption">GLACIER DE LOS TEMPANOS</p>
</div>

<p>Landing at the end of the Canal de los Tempanos we found
ourselves in forests of magnificent timber. The vegetation was
rank and luxuriant, a mass of decay under a forest of life. From
the swampy dank ground tall stems sprang up straight and branchless
as palms, while at their feet grew a carpet of ferns.</p>

<p>We had some marvellous days of fine weather in the Cordillera,
where on the mountain slopes, as winter drew on, the crimson
shades crept deeper to mingle with and finally change the green.
In due time we reached the South Fjord by water. The account
of a previous visit on horseback has already been told. Then we
turned homewards, and on the way I secured some good photos
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
of the great glacier of the Canal de los Tempanos. As we passed
down the canal, a big berg broke off from the glacier ahead of us
and plunged into the water, sending up a huge wave, which luckily
only touched us slightly. It was well we were no nearer. We
witnessed after this the fall of several lesser pieces of ice, the noise
of which resounded loudly among the gorges.</p>

<p>Our return voyage was eventless. While Bernardo was
making our camp-fire upon landing, he called to me to come with
my rifle. He said he had been attacked by a large Cordillera
wolf, which snapped at his legs. He retaliated with an axe, but
it got away. Following in the direction he indicated, I caught a
glimpse of the animal crossing a patch of moonlight, and fired,
hitting it far back.</p>

<p>There are many thousands of square miles of unexplored forest
in Patagonia. It is a region unknown and mysterious, which has
never been deeply explored by man. As has been said, no man
lives in them, and it is a question whether man has ever lived
there, for the one all-sufficient reason&mdash;the practical absence of
game on which he might subsist.</p>

<p>I well remember my first sight of the forests, and the intense
longing that took hold upon me to make my way into their virgin
fastnesses. It is one of the traveller's most unquenchable desires,
this hankering to go where no other man has yet been. It springs,
I suppose, from the undefined thought that in the unknown everything
is possible, though few things perhaps come to pass.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_371" id="i_371"></a>
<img src="images/i_371.jpg" width="550" height="379" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ANOTHER VIEW OF THE GLACIER DE LOS TEMPANOS</p>
</div>

<p>From afar the forests appear to rim the slopes and spurs of the
Cordillera with a seemingly impenetrable mass of blackness, reaching
towards and often running up into the snow-line; as you
approach the colour assumes its true hue, a deep dense green, a
green that seems to have the quality of absorbing light, so that,
as you gaze upon the expanse of foliage stretching back into the
distances, fold beyond fold, where the valleys and mountain-sides
close in behind each other, an impression of gloom and mystery
lays hold upon your mind. Upon still nearer inspection you find
the trees ranked in heavy phalanxes, while between their close-set
trunks has grown up an under-tangle of thorn. Old storms have
overthrown many of the giants, so that they lie in tens and twenties,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
or lean against their yet quick companions awaiting the slow decay
of things. But it is very hard to give any adequate idea in words
of these vast and nameless tree-kingdoms. Most common among
the trees was the antarctic beech. I observed also redwood and
cypress.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_373" id="i_373"></a>
<img src="images/i_373.jpg" width="550" height="396" alt="" />
<p class="caption">GLACIER AND GLACIAL DETRITUS</p>

</div>
<p>There are some wild cattle and huemules to be found in the
outskirts of the woodlands; we also saw parrots, hawks and owls
in some of our wanderings, while in other spots there seemed no
sign of life at all save a few small rodents, and even those, as
we pushed farther into the thicker recesses, disappeared. And
then we came under the sway of that curious silence which broods
among these forest depths.</p>

<p>The aspects of the various forests and the trees of which they
were composed varied greatly. Some were bare and devoid of
undergrowth as a northern forest; others were absolutely tropical
in their heavy luxuriance. In one, a majestic place, the tall
antarctic beeches were draped with long trailing Spanish moss,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
and on the carpet of moss beneath them lay here and there a dead
tree.</p>

<p>Few places are more mournful than this region when rain is
falling. After the rain ceases, mists arise and circle round you,
shutting you in, these in their turn often being dissipated by a
sudden fierce squall. In summer the climate is very humid, and
many of the plants have the fat damp aspect seldom observable
save in the tropics. The huge masses of rank vegetation seem
to stifle you; once you have been in that great black insatiable
woodland you can never quite shake off its influence.</p>

<p>In that particular forest was one glade by the outrunning of a
little brook where the ground was thick with orchids.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>One reads of "virgin forests," but one must behold them to comprehend
the reality that underlies the wording. For days you saw
no living thing, heard no human tones, nothing but the immense
voices of the thunder, the glacier and the everlasting wind. The
solitude of Patagonia, its peculiar characteristic of lack of human life
in the present and the past, was borne in upon one under that high
dome of foliage, and in those aisles abysmally vast, stretching north,
south, east and west. In any other country legends would have
gathered round these places, some touch of man's presence and
adventure humanised them, so to speak. In Patagonia the fancy
had nothing to grip, to grow upon, no story of joy or of sorrow.
Solitude reigned alone, and nature spoke only by the awful uninterpreted
tongues of God's elements.

</p>

<p>After our return from our trip to the South Fjord the weather
became very threatening, and I was beset with many anxious fears
that the winter might set in rigidly, and entirely preclude any
attempt to solve the problem of the yet unvisited and unknown
river and lake whose existence was conjectured at the end of the
North Fjord. Snow fell and blocked the pass to Punta Arenas,<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
which was our south road to the coast, but luckily a milder spell
followed, the snow melted and I was encouraged to remain just a
little longer to carry out my original idea of making another effort
to thoroughly explore the North Fjord.</p>

<p>Storms, however, swept over the lake, and although we undertook
a couple of short expeditions in the launch, we waited for better
days before again facing the difficulties of the Hellgate passage.
Again and again we saw squalls and waterspouts come curling
down the channel between the frowning cliffs. Day followed day
with heavy winds, the coming of the light seemed to be the signal
for the gales to rise, whereas on many nights the weather was fairly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
still, and the water in consequence calmer. It was during this
period of waiting that we arranged the following programme,
which I find scribbled upon a page of my diary:</p>

</div>

<p>At length, weary of waiting on the wind's vagaries, we determined
to start by night, during the quieter period we usually
then enjoyed, and make what progress we could up the intricacies
of Hellgate. Accordingly, at 1 o'clock <span class="s08">P.M.</span> on May 3, we
began our voyage. We passed through Hellgate and left many
silent bays behind us as we kept on our course just outside the inky
shadow of the cliffs. The water was still working after the blow of
the daytime, but on the whole we had favourable weather and the
stars shone brightly. With dawn the wind arose and we were
forced to put in to an anchorage on the east shore of the Fjord.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
Afterwards, travelling by day, we made our way to the peninsula,
rocks often jutted out into the fairway, but these were easy to
locate, as we had been through the channel before and had some
knowledge of its reefs. A number of icebergs had been blown
down out of the western channel, but the water had fallen considerably
since our last visit, and when we reached the peninsula
we found it impossible to resume our former camp there, so we
were forced to pass an uncommonly cold night on a bare bit of
beach without so much as a bush to shelter us.</p>

<p>From time to time we spent a good while on this peninsula. It
was studded with erratic boulders, and the soil on it varied from
six to twelve inches in depth. On this visit I saw a red-crested woodpecker.
The views from the higher part of the peninsula were
infinitely grand. The gigantic glacier, the dark forests, the innumerable
icebergs floating below the black cliffs&mdash;all these combined
to make up pictures which I should like to be able to reproduce.</p>

<p>In time the weather moderated, and we made a last essay to
penetrate to the farther end of the main Fjord. As we proceeded
the water became shallower, so that it was necessary occasionally
to take soundings. There were also many rocks. We once more
noticed dry sticks and leaves drifting past, and presently ahead of
us, through a gap in the Cordillera, we caught a glimpse of flat
country. This time we fulfilled our desire and attained to the
termination of the Fjord, where we came to the mouth of a river of
considerable size. It swung out from round the base of a cliff,
and had thrown up a slight bar where it joined the waters of the
lake. I named it the River Katarina.</p>

<p>We camped at this point and began at once to explore the
valley of the river. It flowed over a stony bed, presenting much
the appearance of a large Scotch trout-stream. The <i>cañadon</i>
through which it passed was very wide, and the stream wound
greatly. At the time of our visit the river was very shallow, and
there was not water enough to float the launch, in fact a stone
picked up from the bottom lodged itself between the blades of the
propeller and we had to haul up for repairs. This business of
repairing was one we often had to perform, and necessity being the
mother of invention, the dodges we resorted to were original.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
The launch, if once hauled up on the beach and sunk in the sand,
would have been too heavy for the three of us to get back into the
water. On these occasions we therefore used to cut the largest tree-trunks
available and roll them under the keel while still half in the
water, then the two heaviest of us would go into the bows, which
were, of course, in comparatively deep water, and our weight in
this position served to raise the stern sufficiently to allow of the
third man to execute the repairs needful to the propeller. In the
present instance it was found that the machinery was severely
strained, though fortunately no damage had been done to the
blades of the propeller.</p>

<p>Though the river was shallow in May, we saw abundant
evidence that it must carry a greatly increased volume of water in
the earlier part of the year. But not finding it possible to take the
launch up the channel, we decided on anchoring her as securely as
we could and continuing our expedition in the small canvas boat.
This we did a day or two later.</p>

<p>Our camping-ground on the bank of the Katarina was among
high and rather coarse grass, which would have made excellent
feed for horses, but I should not think it possible to keep horses in
that <i>cañadon</i>, as, being encircled by hills, the sun would seldom
reach it during the winter. There were many patches of wood,
composed of rather stunted trees, but it was difficult to penetrate
among them, their trunks grew so close together. A certain
amount of game lived in the valley, huemules, guanacos, pumas
and Cordillera wolves.</p>

<p>The extraordinary tameness of the huemul here was, of course,
accounted for by their entire ignorance of man. During my
wanderings from the camp I had opportunities of making many
interesting observations on this point. They would almost
always, if you kept still and made no attempt to approach them,
advance timidly towards you. It was in this valley of the Katarina
that I met with the most remarkable instance of boldness on
the part of these animals. I have given this story in full in another
chapter, but I may shortly allude to it here. I was some miles from
the camp, among thick grass and scrub, when I perceived emerging
from a thicket at a little distance the spiked horns and red-brown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
sides of a huemul buck; behind him were two does, half
hidden in the thicket. Finding that they had perceived me, I lay
down on the grass and watched to see what they would do. One
could read in their movements and attitudes the battle between
timidity and curiosity that was going on within them. A third half-grown
doe now appeared, and all four began to drift, as it were,
slowly in my direction, keeping their eyes fixed upon me all the
time. Now and again they would stop, then move on a few steps
nearer, but after a long time they grew courageous enough to
come right up to me, and the younger doe sniffed at my boot, then
started back some paces, her companions naturally following her
example. I could easily have touched her with my hand during a
good part of the time. At last the buck lowered his horns as if with
the intention of turning me over, but the sun was now sinking, and
I was obliged to take my way homewards. As I stirred the
huemules made off, but halted at a short distance to stare again at
the queer object which had for the first time in their lives entered
within their ken.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span></p>

<p>That evening, as we sat round the camp-fire, Cattle told us an
amusing story illustrative of the quickness with which the Canoe
Indians of the western or Pacific coast pick up the art of bargaining.
He with two companions was living in the eternal rain
of the Chilian side of the Cordillera, when one afternoon they
struck a camp of Canoe Indians, who ran away into the forest on
seeing the boat of the white men coming up the fjord. After a
time, however, curiosity overcame their terror, and an old woman
advanced from under the trees and commenced to open communications
with the travellers by means of signs. She was probably
sent out on account of her uselessness to the tribe, as, in the event
of the white men being evilly disposed, her loss would have been regarded
as no great misfortune. By-and-by she was joined by the
other Indians, and the party fell to bartering. One of the Englishmen
bought a fine sea-otter's skin for a box of matches, and the old
lady, who had made the first advances, was asked by signs if she
had another to dispose of. She ran back into the forest and
presently returned with the half of a skin in each hand. She
demanded a box of matches for each piece, for, thinking to improve
upon the last bargain, she had cut the otter-skin in two with a bit
of glass!</p>

<p>Our next move was to trace the river up to its source. After
assuring ourselves that the launch could not go up the stream,
we made all ship-shape in the camp and prepared to go ahead by
putting our bedding and food in the canvas boat. We set out one
grey morning, following the left bank of the Katarina. Parallel
with the course of the river ran a chain of small hillocks, and
behind these again a series of reedy lagoons. These last were
literally black with duck, especially the variety known locally as the
"white-faced duck," otherwise the Chiloe widgeon. The lagoons
contained brackish water, and I fancy the whole depression in
which they lie is flooded in the spring.</p>

<p>On this day Cattle and I, from the top of a hillock, descried
what we took to be water in the north end of the <i>cañadon</i>. This
was our first sight of the lake the shores of which I afterwards
reached.</p>

<p>In the evening we camped at a spot opposite to the mouth of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
tributary of the Katarina that flowed from the hills on the eastern
side. At this point Bernardo knocked up. He had had hard
work all day with the boat, for the stream was full of shoals, and
wind and current were strong against him. He had been in the
river off and on, and as he was already suffering from a slight cold
when we set out this treatment had not improved it. By night his
chest seemed a good deal affected, and his breathing was difficult.
The rain of the afternoon turned to snow in the night, and it became
very cold, a comfortless position for a feverish man. Our means
for dealing with illness were limited, but hot cocoa and rugs
seemed the best treatment under the circumstances, and we further
sheltered him under the canvas boat, which, being turned over,
made a tolerable hut.</p>

<p class="caption">RIVER KATARINA</p>
</div>

<p>Having brought a certain amount of provisions with us, we
did not shoot much. There can be little question that, had Patagonia
been a country rich in trophies, its less remote valleys would
long ago have known the crack of the rifle. Fortunately for
its <i>feræ naturæ</i>, the small horns of <i>Xenelaphus bisulcus</i> do not
offer sufficient attraction. There is no sport on earth finer than
big-game shooting in moderation, but in all parts of the world I
should like to see a universal law prohibiting any one sportsman
or professional hunter from shooting more than a limited number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
of a particular animal in a year. This idea, as a universal law, is, of
course, impossible of fulfilment, but surely in sport moderation and
a due regard for the survival of the various kinds of game should
be the guiding rule and principle. However, my pen has carried
me away. I merely say that it would be well if public opinion
trended more resolutely towards censuring the hunter who selfishly
makes immoderate bags. At the present moment he is looked
upon as rather a fine fellow by those who lack any real knowledge
of the subject, for no man is more strongly opposed to such doings
than the true sportsman.</p>

<p>Owing to the unfortunate accident of Bernardo's illness, the
general advance of our party was out of the question. It only
remained for me to push on alone, and to give up any attempt
to take the boat farther. Cattle stayed with Bernardo, to look
after him, while I went on up the valley along the banks of the
Katarina.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that all the <i>cañadon</i> of this river
formed at one time part of Lake Argentino, and that the hills in
the valley were merely small islands in the same. One of the
most interesting facts in connection with Lake Argentino is the
large volume of water that is precipitated into it by a number
of rivers and mountain torrents. Besides the Rivers Leona and
Katarina, there are two or three streams of considerable size
and countless snow-fed cascades falling from the cliffs. On the
other hand, the only large outlet is the River Santa Cruz, and
though that river carries off an important amount of water to
the Atlantic, the quantity is not sufficient to account for the fact
that the great lake is surely if slowly shrinking in size. The
North and South Fjords with their adjoining reaches of water
at one time formed part of a wide-spreading lake, whose waters
washed completely round the bases of the mountains&mdash;such
as Mount Buenos Aires&mdash;and of hills that now stand upon out-jutting
points of land or actually upon the present lines of the
shores. The reason for this shrinkage of the lake, when appearances
would seem to point rather to increase of size, is difficult
to discover.</p>

<img src="images/i_385.jpg" width="550" height="380" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE LAST REACH</p>
</div>

<p>The features of the <i>cañadon</i> of the Katarina changed but little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
as I walked on deeper into it. I saw two huemul bucks, one accompanied
by two, the other by three does; I also saw some guanacos.
The Giant's Glacier, which crosses the head of Lake Argentino as
far as the peninsula on which we camped, ran parallel behind the
cliffs of the western shore, glimmering out palely in the north-west
ahead of me. Presently I passed over a stream, and later topping a
low bluff I found myself on the shores of a lake, the distant gleam of
whose waters Cattle and I had seen on the previous day. I was, of
course, very eager to take a photograph of it, but everything around
was shrouded in mist, and I had with me only a binocular camera,
the mechanism of which did not permit of long exposures.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_387" id="i_387"></a>
<img src="images/i_387.jpg" width="550" height="387" alt="" />
<p class="caption">LAKE PEARSON</p>
</div>

<p>I must admit that I was disappointed with the lake when
I arrived at it, as I had expected a much larger piece of water.
The nearer shores were somewhat low and covered with boulders,
while upon the farther sides rose a semicircle of hills whose
escarpments fell in places abruptly to the water. About the inferior
spurs of a somewhat higher mountain to the north a dense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
black forest clung. The morning was grey and the water lay dark
and ruffled under a chilling wind, while about the distant cliffs of
the northern shore wreaths of cloud hung sullenly, only lifting at
intervals here and there sufficient to give a glimpse of the bare
crags behind them.</p>

<p>Towards the afternoon luck befriended me, for the sky cleared
and the sun broke out for a short time, giving me the opportunity
I had been hoping for. I made haste to use the camera with such
results as will be seen on <a href="#i_387">p. 285</a>.</p>

<p>This lake I named Lake Pearson.</p>

<p>On my return to the camp I found the sick man improving,
which was a relief, as under the circumstances we had very little to
give him in the way of comfort. Bernardo was a cheery fellow,
who met the disagreeables of his lot good-temperedly, and I have
no doubt this helped towards his recovery. Eventually he became
quite well.</p>

<p>During the night a comet was visible, hanging in the clear
sky like a white sword, hilt downwards. It was very brilliant and
very beautiful, seen as we saw it above the dark forest.</p>

<p>There were many reasons why I hoped to be able to push
deeper into this region, but it was growing very late in the season,
winter with its accompaniment of furious storms was almost upon
us, and this fact, joined with the strained and weakened condition
of the engine of the launch, compelled us to give up the thought of
further exploration. We therefore took advantage of a spell of
rather better weather to make our way back down the Fjord. The
wind was blowing sulkily out of the north, but this gave us
the benefit of a following sea. Once or twice during our passage
squalls overtook us, but always blowing mercifully in the direction
of our course. Thus we had a following sea right up to the cliffs
of Hellgate. In one place a big iceberg had stranded beneath the
cliffs.</p>

<p>We landed under the bluffs of Hellgate and lit a fire of <i>Leña
dura</i>, which roared and crackled in the dusk, lighting up the gloom
of Hellgate with red light. Later we ran across safely to our
anchorage off the Burmeister Peninsula.

taught me.
</p>

<p>A fortnight before we started there was a couple of feet of snow
on the high pampa. Beside the lake it had been blowing heavily,
and storms of sleet followed each other in dreary succession.
Every morning we saw the white cloak of winter throwing its
snowy folds lower and lower upon the mountains. The severe
season of the Cordillera and Southern Patagonia was fast shutting
us in; already the Pass to Punta Arenas was closed feet deep in
snow, and our only outlet for the south lay towards Gallegos. It
had been my wish to remain as long as possible in the neighbourhood
of the Andes, but I had overstayed the utmost limit I originally
set myself, and now there was nothing for it but to make a
rush for the coast while the journey could still be made.</p>

<p>On May 15 we started in heavy rain. The horses were in
excellent condition; indeed, they were too fat, for of late they had
not had enough exercise to prepare them for a very trying journey.
We took three <i>cargueros</i> besides the horses for riding, and the
party consisted of Mr. Cattle's shepherd, George Gregory, Bernardo
and myself. At the second camp Gregory was obliged to turn
back, as his horses&mdash;a troop of colts&mdash;had wandered during the
night. This was at the River del Bote; from there Bernardo and
I went on alone. We found the aspect of the country much
changed since we had crossed it three and a half months previously.
The green grass had grown yellow, the streams and the lagoons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
were drying up, numbers of guanaco had descended to the lower
grounds. An Indian trader, accompanied by a few tents of Indians,
had taken up quarters near the River Califate, a spot formerly
inhabited by wildfowl only. For three days we followed the shore
of the lake, but then our way led us up on to the high pampa, where
we made our camp in a bushless <i>cañadon</i> beside a rocky pool. By
this time the horses were beginning to lose their tricks, but at the
outset they would hardly allow themselves to be caught, and they
wandered every night. The <i>cañadon</i> was clear of snow, but the
sky was heavy with the promise of it. We hoped most heartily
that it would give us two more days' grace before it fell.</p>

<p>The next day we followed the <i>cañadon</i>, which was a shallow
depression running south-west. There was no fuel to be found
but the thin roots of the dark bush known as <i>maté negra</i>. The
early frosts made travelling difficult, as it was necessary to off-saddle
early, that the horses might not be turned out sweating into
the cold. We covered sixty miles, changing horses three times,
for it was quite clear that we must push on if we hoped to escape
the snow. That was one of the most fatiguing marches we had
during the whole expedition. About three o'clock I espied some
herds of tame cattle in the distance by the side of a lagoon.
These proved to belong to some tents of Indians. The men were
absent hunting and the camp was given over to the women and
decrepit dogs. An enormous <i>china</i> sat in the opening of the
largest <i>toldo</i>; she must have weighed twenty odd stone! We learned
from her that the season had been a good one for guanaco <i>chicos</i>.</p>

<p>In reply to our question as to how far we might be from the
nearest white man's habitation on the next stage of our journey, the
fat lady waved her hand picturesquely and vaguely towards the
eastern sky but did not commit herself to figures.</p>

<p>The Indian encampment made a singular picture against a
somewhat striking background. The western sky was piling up
and bulged with snow-clouds, while the sinking sun glowed like a
red-hot cannon ball on the rim of the pampa. Against this curtain
of colour were set the brown tents of guanaco-skin. In one of
these a small fire was burning with little flames about an old meat
tin in which water was being boiled for <i>maté</i>. Around the women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
sat in silence&mdash;saving only the fat spokeswoman&mdash;inert and apparently
content; occasionally one would grunt or shift the child at
her breast, but otherwise one heard scarce a sound but the whimpering
of the wind from the Cordillera or the plashing of the wildfowl
in the swampy margin of the lagoon.</p>

<p>I need not describe at length the days which followed. In
due time we came upon a wheeltrack and sighted the first fence.
This was in the valley of the River Coyly, a good place for pasturing
sheep, but inexpressibly desolate and monotonous in aspect.
For two days we held along in this valley or on the pampa
immediately above it, but, remembering our experiences near
Santa Cruz, I resolved to sleep in no <i>boliche</i> until we reached
Gallegos.</p>

<p>The <i>cañadon</i> of the Coyly was fenced at intervals, the grass
eaten close to the ground by many sheep. Thousands of wild
geese clamoured on the banks of the river. In this river valley
we made our last camp in Patagonia. There was no wood for
fire, and the horses found but little to eat, the sun set among sickly
green lights, and presently rain came on. Altogether it made
a dismal good-bye to the life we had led for so many months.</p>

<p>The following day, striking across the pampa for the River
Gallegos, we knew ourselves to be entering on the last stage of our
wanderings. And here we very nearly had a disastrous accident.
Meeting two Gauchos, we asked them about the condition of the
ford over the Gallegos, which they told us had been but hock-high
when they passed through with their horses. Consequently, when
we arrived at the ford half an hour later, we took our troop down
into the water, but seeing it looked uncommonly deep for the description
given us by the Gauchos, we returned to the shore, and, as
there happened to be a house at no great distance, I sent Bernardo
to make inquiries. He brought back the news that the tide
was running strong and the ford quite impracticable, but it was
possible that we might be able to cross higher up at another spot.
We followed this advice and crossed in safety, I with my
precious photographs tied round my neck; but had we tried
the lower ford I am very sure I should have lost them all, which
would have been a disappointment indeed, considering the circumstances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
under which they had been taken and the impossibility of
replacing them.</p>

<p>Once across the Gallegos we emerged upon flat ground, and
here we found a road with a line of telephone-posts running along
one side of it. Gallegos was by that time only eighteen miles
ahead, but with our tired horses that appeared a long distance.
The country was absolutely featureless, the black posts sticking up
against a dull sky, the brown earth absorbing such light as there
was. A very cold wind blew across our faces, but there was one
thing that cheered us, that told us our wanderings were over&mdash;the
humming of the wind in the wires overhead.</p>

<p>The road dipped and rose over the long undulations, and at
last, as we topped one of the many inclines, Gallegos straggled into
sight, obviously a frontier town, all wire fences, wooden and
corrugated-iron houses with painted roofs. The emotions with
which one returns and feels the long wanderings over are not
easy to describe. I rode slowly up the main street and passed the
bank&mdash;for there is a bank at Gallegos, and the fact gave one a
sensation of being very civilised indeed. I dismounted and went
into the building to inquire about the steamer for Punta Arenas,
where I hoped to pick up a homeward-bound boat. A steamboat
was to have started for Punta Arenas that same morning, I was
told, but as the captain was in gaol, her departure had been postponed
for a day or so. The delay seemed a special dispensation
for my benefit, for, had she adhered to her original date, I must
have been too late to go by her. I understood that the captain's
crime lay in having drawn up his anchor without waiting to
receive a written permit.</p>

<p>Luckily I had not been preceded at Gallegos by any "lord,"
hence I drew the cash necessary for my passage and payments at
the bank without any trouble. Then I went on to the hotel and
put up my horse, the good little big-hearted Moro, who had carried
me a hundred and fifty miles in three days and looked fat on it.
Afterwards I bought a cigar, a very bad one, but a cigar for all
that, and so proceeded down to the beach to secure my passage.
Up on the shingle were several ships high and dry, and out in the
fairway about the very smallest steamer I have ever seen, yet a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
good sea-boat, as I afterwards proved. She rejoiced in a brilliant
green deck-house two storeys high, and the funnel was almost on
top of the propeller!</p>

<p>When it grew dark it was strange to walk through the lighted
streets and to see the faces pass and repass beneath the lamps.
There was a delightful sense of newness about it all. But perhaps
the most strange sensation was produced by a visit to the hairdresser's
shop, where one could watch in the glass the swift transformation.
Afterwards it was quite good to smoke a second
execrable cigar, and to listen to the hotel-keeper in another room
telling some of his friends how he had mistaken me for a camp-loafer
owing to my patched clothes and the ragged remnants of
my boots, and had, in consequence, led me to an outhouse, proposing
to allow me to sleep there!</p>

<p>Best of all, perhaps, was the civilised dinner, despite the attentions
of an intoxicated itinerant dentist, who kept on reiterating
the same question, "Have you ever been to Nahuelhuapi?" the
<i>huapi</i> ending in a wail&mdash;"w-a-a-a-pi." Bernardo had not turned
up from the farm where we had left the horses, and a gentleman
connected with the Government who was present, understanding
that I wished to see him before sailing, offered to send a file of
soldiers to look for him. Presently Bernardo arrived, and then
we went away and lit our pipes for a last talk over it all.</p>

<p>Next morning on the wet shingle I said good-bye to him,
and there he stood for a while as the boat shoved off and we
rowed away. A wild figure was Master Bernardo, for he had not
yet had time to clothe himself in the garments of civilisation.
With his ragged blue jersey and his big boots of <i>potro</i> hide, surmounted
by his pleasant bearded face, he watched us through the
wind and the rain, and then he turned and walked away, passing
out of sight among the sheds. He was going to Santa Cruz by
the horse-track. Good luck to him, and may we meet again!</p>

<p>I went aboard, little guessing the pleasure that awaited me, for
at the gangway-head I met Mr. Waag and Mr. Von Plaaten
Hallermund, of the Boundary Commission, who were on their way
down from Santa Cruz to Punta Arenas. Mr. Waag and I had just
missed each other by a couple of hours on the pampa up country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
some months earlier. We were soon deep in talk about the
Cordillera, and all that had happened to the three of us since we
last met at the Hotel Ph&oelig;nix in Buenos Aires. Mr. Waag
had had a successful time about Lake Puerrydon, and Mr. Von
Plaaten Hallermund at Lake San Martin. Meantime the <i>Elena</i> got
in her anchor, and we were in the Magellan Straits by nightfall.</p>

<img src="images/i_394.jpg" width="550" height="403" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PUNTA ARENAS</p>
</div>

<p>And so we reached Punta Arenas, where I was shown much
hospitality by Mr. Perkins, and where I had the pleasure of meeting
Mr. Fred Waldron, in whose company, as well as that of Mr.
Waag and Mr. Von Plaaten Hallermund, I made the passage to
Buenos Aires by the Pacific Company's steamship the <i>Orellana</i>,
and so home.</p>

<p>To turn for a moment to the personal point of view. I had
landed in Patagonia with enthusiasm, and I left it not in the least
damped or disheartened in that enthusiasm, but very much the
opposite. I had learned many lessons of life, passed through
many experiences, explored a small part of the earth's surface,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
and made some original observations with regard to the zoology
of the country and other matters, but I am inclined to think that
the most useful lesson to myself was one that sank deeper and
deeper into my mind, I might say heart, with every day lived in
these great solitudes&mdash;and that was the knowledge of my own
ignorance. The long solitary days in the forests, on the pampas,
and about the stormy fjords of the Cordillera brought me face
to face with Nature. There are many voices in the silence of
Nature. The stars above, the waters beneath, and the earth all
spoke in a hundred tongues, and little enough of it all could I,
with my lack of knowledge, interpret. "There are many kinds
of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification,"
but so long as they spoke to me in unknown tongues how much
was I the better? And there it was I learned the useful truth that,
to be a traveller of any value, a man must also be an adequate
interpreter.</p>

<h2>A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF
PATAGONIA</h2>

<p>It would be possible to write a very long chapter about the future
of Patagonia. I do not, however, propose to do this, but to write
what I have to say as briefly as possible.</p>

<p>To begin with, Patagonia can boast of a fine climate, for, though
the winters are certainly hard, no endemic disease exists. The
country is exceptionally healthy, nor are there any poisonous reptiles
to endanger life on its far-reaching pampas. There are few parts
of the earth of which so much can be said.</p>

<p>A large portion of the land is eminently suited for the support
of sheep, as the enormous and prosperous sheep-farms to be found
along the east and south coasts bear witness. Cattle and horse-breeding
are also successfully carried on, and although a portion
of the country is unsuited for agricultural purposes, it is equally
certain that large expanses of ground of great fertility and rich
promise are to be found here.</p>

<p>The tide of pastoral life from the thriving southern farms
round and about Punta Arenas on the Straits of Magellan, and
Gallegos on the Atlantic coast, is setting strongly north and west.
The crying want of the country is capital to open up means of
communication with the interior. At present there are no railways
or other settled lines for the transport of produce, although I believe
a steam-launch has lately been placed upon the River Santa Cruz.
In consequence of this lack some farmers have to carry wool two
hundred miles by bullock-cart to the coast; a few cover even a
greater distance. To send wool two hundred miles in bullock-carts
means at least three weeks of travel. To go and come from
the farm to the coast would thus take up about two months of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
farmer's time. <i>Peones</i> are necessary to look after the carts, and
their wage is at least £5 a month and their keep. Then carts not
infrequently break down upon the rough surfaces of the pampas
and in the <i>cañadones</i>, hence more delay. Even when the port is
reached difficulties have to be surmounted, for none of them, with
the exception of Punta Arenas, are served by any steamship lines.
This was so at the time of my being in Patagonia last year
(1901). Government transports from Buenos Aires had the whole
of the coast service of Argentine Patagonia in their hands, and
these could boast of only very uncertain dates of departure and
still more uncertain dates of arrival.</p>

<p>All these difficulties of transit do not make for prosperity. I
understand that of late a German line has undertaken to call at
some of the ports, and if they carry out their contract it should
help events in Patagonia to get into the stride of success.</p>

<p>On the coast-farms, where ships could and did occasionally put
in, especially in the wool season, money was made and men began
to see fortune ahead. But far away in the interior, where a very
few pioneers have made their homes beside a lake here and there,
the wide and uninhabited pampas lie between the producer and his
market. Until railways open up the land the position of these
people cannot much improve. They are too heavily handicapped
in the race.</p>

<p>It is almost impossible to tell what enormous numbers of sheep
and cattle Patagonia could produce for the providing of the world
if capital and enterprise would but pave the way. In the meantime
the country remains the paradise of the middleman. At present
there is little money in hand, much of the trade is carried on by
barter, and on this system there is always an evil tendency towards
profits accruing mostly to the storekeepers, who gradually become
more or less masters of the situation. Many of the small farmers
are deeply in debt to this class. A hard winter&mdash;and there are
often very hard winters&mdash;fills the pocket of the storekeeper, for
they advance provisions, without which no man can continue to
live, and they, of course, thus secure mortgages on the farms.</p>

<p>This same unfortunate liability is observable in other countries
where similar conditions obtain, but the opening up of the interior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
of Patagonia and the introduction of capital in the hands of
employers of labour would probably lessen the pressure of hard
times on the poorer farmers.</p>

<p>Beyond the pampas again tower the unnumbered peaks of the
Cordillera, and among them all things, minerally speaking, are
possible. Perhaps the future of Patagonia is to be found there. In
a few years the Patagonian Andes may be as commonly known a
seeking-place for fortune as Klondyke is to-day. But concerning
this part of the subject I have nothing to say, being no prophet of
El Dorados.</p>

<p>Although during our travels we had little time to spare for
prospecting, or searching for the mineral wealth which may lie
hidden in the Cordillera, yet there was one obvious source of
riches that was always before our eyes in those regions.</p>

<p>The coast-towns of Patagonia are supplied with wood by sea
from the woodlands of Tierra del Fuego, and this while many
square miles about the bases of the Andes are covered with
dense forests of magnificent growth. Here are to be found
beech, cypress and redwood, not to speak of other trees, but the
absolute absence of any means of conveying logs to the coast has
so far left this store of wealth untouched. Until better means of
transport can be developed, there are certainly one or two rivers
which might be made use of in this connection.</p>

<p>I can only insist upon the fact that Patagonia is a great though
at present undeveloped land; that it cries aloud to railway enterprise
to become its salvation. Nevertheless, it is even now a good
country for the man ready and able to work. A capable man will
make £6 a month and his keep, but he must know the work
required of him; a considerable time has to be spent in learning the
skilled labour of camp life, and very hard labour that sometimes is.
An emigrant does not consequently find it so easy to get employment.
But, given vigorous health, an aptitude for hard work, and
a small sum in hand to keep him going until he is broken in to the
necessities of the life, and I know of few countries more favourable
to the <i>unmarried</i> working man.</p>

<p>There is something further which I should like to suggest to
intending emigrants of my own nation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span></p>

<p>The greatest of British exports is, one might contend,
Britishers.</p>

<p>The attitude of the young Britisher abroad towards the rest of
the world in general is at once a source of great national strength
and of serious national weakness.</p>

<p>First, as we know, he is a poor linguist, who prefers to go on
speaking his own language, and, when not understood, attempting
to enforce comprehension by the very simple expedient of shouting
louder. The result of this uncompromising attitude, backed by a
good national financial status, is that as the mountain will not go to
Mahomet, Mahomet must needs come to the mountain, and the
foreign Mahomet does come, wrestling his way through difficulties
of pronunciation. By his attitude in this matter&mdash;an attitude
dictated partly by a too common lack of the linguistic faculty and
partly by a certain rooted conviction that a man who cannot speak
English is a man of "lesser breed"&mdash;the Britisher has to a certain
extent forced English upon a very unwilling world.</p>

<p>But whether this question of the one-language system is a loss
or a gain to the country, it is very certain that there is another
idiosyncrasy of the Englishman abroad which is an undoubted loss.
Every country has its own ways and methods, not only peculiar
to its inhabitants but adapted to their special needs. And here
the brusque unadaptability of the Englishman becomes pitifully
apparent.</p>

<p>He loses immensely by it. He will ride on his English saddle
because he has been used to ride on it at home; he will wear his
pigskin leggings for precisely the same reason.</p>

<p>You cannot teach him that he who walks in a noontide sun
in latitudes near the equator is sometimes apt to contract a
fever. Of course I refer chiefly to the "new chum," but we have
an unfortunate gift of remaining new chums for an indefinite
period.</p>

<p>Our young blood is very sure of himself, which is a first-rate
national trait, and one to which as a nation we, no doubt, owe
much. But it has its drawbacks. Thus, although he is physically
excellent beyond his fellows, his death-rate is usually heavier,
which in the nature of things it ought not to be.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span></p>

<p>But in cases where adhesion to the methods of the country to
which he has migrated touches not himself but his goods and his
work he needlessly&mdash;indeed, almost mischievously&mdash;handicaps
himself. He takes pride in occupying a position of more or less
splendid isolation.</p>

<p>The Britisher lacks adaptability. He lacks suavity. He often
lacks common politeness. In fact, he is a good fellow when you
know him, but you have got to know him first. An excellent
reputation to possess, perhaps, apart from business, and when your
position is assured. But in foreign countries, and in the case of
dealing with strangers of other nations, who are very apt to like
or dislike at first sight, its results are disastrous, for they rarely
reconsider their first opinion.</p>

<p>The Continental races, on the other hand, aim at merging their
individuality in that of their temporary hosts. Actuated by a
sense of politeness or of self-interest&mdash;I do not know which&mdash;these
peoples do not thrust forward the fact that they are aliens, but
rather try to foster the idea that the land of their adoption is their
own. But when the young Englishman comes along, his manner
placards him with his nationality. He seems to say, "You fellows,
I've got to live here, Fate orders it. But I am not of you. Apart
from business, leave me alone."</p>

<p>He and his compatriots are sufficient unto themselves. And
not infrequently also, though strangers in a strange land, they are
a law unto themselves. Now this is all very well in its way, and
we would not, I suppose, have it otherwise; yet, if the English
youth abroad would modify their attitude towards the works of the
alien, even while, if they so choose, preserving it towards the alien
himself, they would rise to greater heights of success than they at
present touch.</p>

<p>The fact is that the alien thinks the Englishman is a fool of a
very notable kind, and in many cases he is right.</p>

<p>It is not in the excellence of their goods, or even in the
cheapness of their tariff, that the Germans are forging ahead of
us in trade. It is in their attitude towards those with whom
they deal. They make an art of selling a yard of red flannel
to an elderly negress. The negress feels the compliment, rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
despises the complimenter, but likes it on the whole&mdash;and comes
again.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>While the German studies the people who are to buy his goods
in a spirit of subtlety, the Englishman makes up his mind without
considering anybody save himself and his own ideas. In the days
before competition assumed its present proportions this was all
very well, perhaps; or at least it was not the commercial suicide
that it certainly is to-day.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of the employer, the Englishman does
not know his work. He has no money. He must, therefore,
earn something. He expects to be allowed to earn and learn at
one and the same time, which is an absurd notion.</p>

<p>The cause of all this is the same as that which sends out first-rate
goods but to the wrong market.</p>

<p>The fact is, we do not study our markets seriously either for
mercantile or for human exports.</p>

<p>If the South Sea Islanders want red cloth we send them yellow,
and if in Patagonia there is an opening for men who are decent
practical blacksmiths, we send them a stream of youths who have
never fullered a shoe, but who are well up in the rudiments of
Greek.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX A</h2>

<p>The expedition sent out to Patagonia under my charge by Mr. C. Arthur
Pearson owed its origin to the discoveries made in that country by
Dr. F. P. Moreno of certain remains of an animal, the Pampean Mylodon
or Giant Ground Sloth, long believed to belong to the category of extinct
prehistoric mammals. The marvellous state of preservation of the
remains found at Last Hope Inlet seemed to give some ground for
the supposition that the animal might possibly have survived to a
recent period. Professor Ray Lankester, the Director of the British
Museum of Natural History, in commenting upon the chance of the
Mylodon being still alive in some remote and unknown region of Patagonia,
said: "It is quite possible&mdash;I don't want to say more than that&mdash;that
he still exists in some of the mountainous regions of Patagonia."
These words from such an authority carried weight, and the question
assumed an importance that made it worth all practicable examination.
I have in the following pages put the whole case as clearly and as
definitely as lies in my power.</p>

<p>To begin with, I give the story of Dr. Moreno's discovery as he himself
told it to the Zoological Society, and the description of the remains
by Dr. A. Smith Woodward, LL.D., F.R.S.</p>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">Account of the Discovery.</span> By Dr. <span class="smcap">Moreno</span>.</h3>

<p>In November 1897 I paid a visit to that part of the Patagonian
territory which adjoins the Cordillera of the Andes, between the 51st and
52nd degrees of South latitude, where certain surveyors, under my
direction, were carrying out the preliminary studies connected with the
boundary-line between Chile and Argentina; and in the course of this
expedition I reached Consuelo Cove, which lies in Last Hope Inlet. In
that spot, hung up on a tree, I found a piece of a dried skin, which attracted
my attention most strangely, as I could not determine to what class of
Mammalia it could belong, more especially because of the resemblance of
the small incrusted bones it contained to those of the Pampean <i>Mylodon</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
On inquiring whence it came, I was informed that it was only a fragment
of a large piece of skin which had been discovered two years before, by
some Argentine officers, in a cavern which existed in the neighbouring
heights. Immediately on receiving this news, I hastened to the spot,
guided by a sailor who had been present when the original discovery had
been made. As, at that moment, I had no means of making more than
a few hurried excavations, which gave no further traces of the discovery,
I left orders that the search should be continued after my departure; but
this once more also failed to give any ultimate results. Nothing could
be found but modern remains of small rodents, and these chiefly on or
near the surface of the ground. From the most careful inquiries which I
set on foot, it appeared that, when the first discovery was made, no bones
were found, the skin being half buried in the dust which had accumulated
from the gradual falling away of the roof of the cavern, composed of
Tertiary Conglomerate. It was only in the broad entrance to the cavern
that were found a few human bones, borne thence to the shore of the
Cove and afterwards broken up.</p>

<p>As already stated, the skin here presented to you formed but a small
part of a larger one. One small piece had been carried off by Dr. Otto
Nordenskjöld, and others by officers of the Chilian Navy, who later on
had visited the spot. The inhabitants of the locality looked upon it as
an interesting curiosity, some of them believing that it was the hide of a
cow incrusted with pebbles, and others asserting that it was the skin of a
large Seal belonging to a hitherto unknown species.</p>

<p>In Consuelo Cove, I embarked on board a small Argentine transport,
which had been placed at my disposal to carry out the study of the
western coast as far as Port Montt, in lat. 42°. At this latter place
I left the steamer, which then proceeded to make a series of surveys.
These lasted until her return to La Plata, at the latter end of July 1898,
when she brought back to me the fragment of skin in question.</p>

<p>This is an accurate and true version of the discovery of this skin,
which gave rise to the publication of Señor Ameghino's small pamphlet,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
in which he gave an account of the discovery of a living representative of
the "Gravigrades" of Argentina, distinguishing it by the name of
"<i>Neomylodon listai</i>".</p>

<p>I have an idea that Señor Ameghino never saw the skin itself, but
only some of the small incrusted bones, of which he had obtained possession.
The vague form in which he draws up his account compels me to
believe this suspicion to be true.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span></p>

<p>My opinion is that this skin belongs to a genuine Pampean <i>Mylodon</i>,
preserved under peculiar circumstances resembling those to which we owe
the skin and feathers of the Moa. I have always maintained that the
Pampean Edentates, now extinct, disappeared only in the epoch which is
called the "historical epoch" of our America. In the province of Buenos
Aires, buried chiefly in the humus, I have found remains of <i>Panochthus</i>,
and others of the same <i>Mylodon</i> from the seashore, all of which present
the same characteristic marks of preservation as the remains of human
beings discovered in the same spot. In this identical layer of the
sea-shore, close to the bones I have also found stones polished by
the hand of man, and flints cut like those found in the Pampean
formation. In 1884, in a cavern near to the Rio de los Patos, in the
Cordillera, I discovered some paintings in red ochre, one of which,
in my opinion, resembles the <i>Glyptodon</i> on account of the shape of the
carapace.</p>

<p>Ancient chroniclers inform us that the indigenous inhabitants recorded
the existence of a strange, ugly, huge hairy animal which had its abode in
the Cordillera to the south of lat. 37°. The Tehuelches and the Gennakens
have mentioned similar animals to me, of whose existence their
ancestors had transmitted the remembrance; and in the neighbourhood
of the Rio Negro, the aged cacique Sinchel, in 1875, pointed out to me
a cave, the supposed lair of one of these monsters, called "Ellengassen";
but I must add that none of the many Indians with whom I have conversed
in Patagonia have ever referred to the actual existence of animals
to which we can attribute the skin in question, nor even of any which
answer to the suppositions of Señor Ameghino according to Señor Lista.
It is but rarely that a few Otters (<i>Lutra</i>) are found in the lakes and
rivers of the Andes, as in the neighbourhood of Lake Argentino, in the
"Sierra de las Viscachas," and in the regions which I believe Señor Lista
visited, there are only a few scarce Chinchillas (<i>Lagidium</i>), which have a
colouring more dark greyish than those found to the north, and are in
every case separated from these by a large extent of country.</p>

<p>The Pampean Edentata have in former days certainly existed as far
south as the extreme limit of Patagonia. In 1874, in the bay of Santa
Cruz, I met with the remains of a <i>pelvis</i> of one of these animals in Pleistocene
deposits, and also remains of the mammals which are found in the
same formation, such as the <i>Macrauchenia</i> and <i>Auchenia</i>. It would not
be astonishing that the skin of one of these should have been preserved
so long, because of the favourable conditions of the spot in which it was
found.</p>

<p>The state of preservation of this piece of skin, at first sight, makes it
difficult for one to believe it to be of great antiquity; but this is by
no means an impossibility, if we consider the conditions of the cave in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
which it was found, the atmosphere of which is not so damp as one might
at first imagine it to be, although it is situated in the woody regions near
to the glaciers and lakes. It is well to mention that in 1877, under
similar conditions, and in a much smaller cave, scarcely five metres from
the waters of Lake Argentino, situated sixty miles more to the north, I
discovered a mummified human body painted red, with the head still
covered in part with its short hair wonderfully preserved, and wrapped up
in a covering made of the skin of a Rhea, and holding in its arms a
large feather of the Condor, also painted red; this was all covered up
with a layer of grass and dust fallen from the roof of the cave. In
another cave in the neighbourhood I discovered a large trunk of a tree,
painted with figures in red, black, and yellow. The sides of the rock
close to the entrance of the cave were covered with figures, some representing
the human hand, others combinations of curved, straight, and
circular lines, painted white, red, yellow, and green. Now, this mummy,
which is preserved in the Museum of La Plata, does not belong to any of
the actual tribes of Patagonia. Its skull resembles rather one of those
more ancient races found in the cemeteries in the valley of the Rio Negro&mdash;a
most interesting fact, since they belong to types which have completely
disappeared from the Patagonian regions, and it is well known
that the actual Tehuelches may be considered to have been the last
indigenous races which reached the territory of Patagonia. Many a time
the Tehuelches have spoken to me of these caves as abodes of the evil
"spirits," and of the enigmatical painted figures they contained: some
attributed the latter to these same "spirits," others to men of other races,
of whom they have no recollection. In another cave, four hundred miles
farther to the north, in 1880, I discovered other human bodies, more or
less mummified and in good preservation, but of a different type, and
beside them some painted poles which served to hold up their small
tents, the use of which had already disappeared more than three centuries
ago; together with the upper part of the skull of a child perfectly
scooped out like a cup. And yet the historical Tehuelches, the same as
all the indigenous races in the southern extremity of South America, hold
their dead in great respect, and never use such drinking-vessels.</p>

<p>These proofs of the favourable conditions of the climate and of the
lands near to the Cordillera, which are revealed to us by the preservation
of objects undoubtedly dating from very remote epochs, strengthen my
opinion that this skin of a huge mammal, which has long since disappeared,
may well have been preserved till the present time.</p>

<p>I may add that a further careful search is now being made in the
earth forming the floor of the cave, and I hope in due time to have the
honour of communicating the results to this Society.

<h3>II. <span class="smcap">Description and Comparison of the Specimen.</span><br />
By <span class="smcap">A. Smith Woodward</span>.</h3>

<h4>(a) <i>Description.</i></h4>

<p>The problematical piece of skin discovered by Dr. Moreno measures
approximately 0.48 m. in the direction of the main lie of the hair, while
its maximum extent at right angles to this direction is about 0.55 m.
The fragment, however, is very irregular in shape; and it has become
much distorted in the process of drying, so that the anterior portion,
which is directed upwards in the drawing, is bent outwards at a considerable
angle to the main part of the specimen which will be claimed
to represent the back. The skin, as observed in transverse section,
presents a dried, felt-like aspect; but there is a frequent ruddiness, suggestive
of blood-stains, while the margin exhibits distinct indications of
freshly dried once-fluid matter, which Dr. Vaughan Harley has kindly
examined and pronounced to be serum. Its outer face is completely
covered with hair, except in the region marked C and above B, where this
covering seems to have been comparatively fine and may have been
accidentally removed. The inner face of the skin is only intact in a few
places, the specimen having contracted and perhaps been somewhat
abraded, so that a remarkable armour of small bony tubercles, irregularly
arranged and of variable size, is exposed over the greater part of it. At
one point there is an irregular rounded hole about 0.02 m. in diameter,
which might possibly have been caused by a bullet or a dagger, but in
any case was probably pierced when the skin was still fresh. Owing to
its direction, this hole is partly obscured by the overhanging hair.</p>

<p>The skin in its dried state varies in thickness in different parts. The
average thickness of the flattened portion, which must be referred to the
back, is shown by the cleanly-cut right margin of the specimen to be
0.01 m. This is slightly increased towards the posterior (lower) end of
the border, while above it the thickness becomes 0.015 m. The latter
thickness also seems to be attained in the much-shrivelled corner
marked C&mdash;a circumstance suggesting bilateral symmetry between at least
part of the two anterior outer angles of the specimen. The thinnest portion
preserved is the border above B; and the skin must also have been
comparatively thin in the region of the accidental notch to the left,
considerably below C.</p>

<p>The portion of skin above B is interesting not only from its relative
thinness, but also from the occurrence of an apparently natural rounded
concavity in the margin. This excavation, which measures 0.05 m. along
the curve, is marked by the remains of a thin flexible flap, which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
sharply bent outwards, and is covered with short hairs on its outer face.
It is especially suggestive of the base of an ear-conch; and if this appearance
be not deceptive, it is worthy of note that the dried skin hereabouts
and in the region which would have to be interpreted as cheek (C) is
much more wrinkled than elsewhere.</p>

<p class="caption">SKIN OF GRYPOTHERIUM, INNER VIEW. ¼ nat. size.</p>
</div>

<p>As already mentioned, the outer aspect of the skin is completely
covered with hair, which is very dense everywhere except on the left
anterior corner. Here it seems to have been removed by abrasion. A
small patch of hair has also clearly been pulled out near the gap in
the left border of the specimen; and close to the middle (where marked D)
there is a small hairless depression which may perhaps be interpreted as a
wound inflicted and healed during life. The hair is only of one kind,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
without any trace of under-fur, and it is still very firmly implanted in the
skin, without signs of decay. Its arrangement seems to be quite regular,
there being no tendency towards its segregation into small groups or
bundles. It is of a uniform dirty yellowish or light yellowish-brown
colour, and, making due allowance for slight ruffling and distortion of the
specimen, it may be described as all lying in one direction, vertically
in the photograph, except at the two upturned anterior corners of
the specimen, where there is an inclination from the right and left
respectively towards the centre. The longest hairs, which usually measure
from 0.05 m. to 0.065 m. in length, are observed in the half of the
specimen in front of (above) the letter D. Those in the middle of
the extreme anterior (upper) border measure from 0.03 m. to 0.05 m. in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
length, those at the hinder (lower) border about the same; while some of
the comparatively small and delicate hairs on the supposed cheek are not
longer than 0.01 m. The hairs are stiff, straight, or only very slightly
wavy, and all are remarkably tough. Examined under the microscope,
their cuticle is observed to be quite smooth, while the much-elongated
cells of the cortex are readily distinguishable. Mr. R. H. Burne has
kindly made some transverse sections, which prove the hairs to be
almost or quite cylindrical, and none of the specimens examined present
any trace of a medulla.</p>

<p>The dermal ossicles are very irregular in arrangement, but are to be
observed in every part of the specimen, even in the comparatively thin
region near the supposed ear. They form everywhere a very compact
armour, and some of them are quite closely pressed together; rarely,
indeed, there is a shallow groove crossing a specimen, possibly indicating
two components which were originally separate. As shown by every part
of the cut margin, and especially well in a small section prepared by
Prof. Charles Stewart, they are all confined to the lower half of the
dermis, never encroaching upon the upper portion in which the hair is
implanted. It is also to be observed that, where the inner surface of
the skin is intact, the ossicles are completely embedded and only faintly
visible through the dry tissue. The exposure of a considerable number
of them, as already mentioned, is due to the rupture and partial abrasion
of this surface. No tendency to arrangement in parallel lines or bands
can be detected; and large and small ossicles seem to be indiscriminately
mingled, although of course allowance must be made, in
examining sections and the abraded inner view of the skin, for differences
in the plane of adjoining sections and varying degrees of exposure
by the removal of the soft tissue. The largest ossicles are oblong in
shape when viewed from within, and measure approximately 0.015 m.
by 0.010 m.; but the majority are much smaller than these. They are
very variable and irregular in form; but their inner face is generally
convex, sometimes almost pyramidal, while the outer face of the few
which have been examined is slightly convex, more or less flattened,
without any trace of regular markings.</p>

<p>In microscopical structure the dermal ossicles are of much interest,
and I have examined both horizontal and vertical sections, one of the
former kindly prepared by Prof. Charles Stewart. The tissue is traversed
in all directions by a dense mass of interlacing bundles of connective-tissue
fibres, which exhibit an entirely irregular disposition, except quite
at the periphery of the ossicle. Here they are less dense, and are
arranged in such a manner as to form at least one darkened zone
concentric with the margin in the comparatively translucent border.
Occasionally, but not at all points, the fibres in this peripheral area
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
may be observed to radiate regularly outwards. Numerous small vascular
canals, frequently branching, are cut in various directions; and the
bony tissue, which is developed in every part of the ossicle, exhibits
abundant lacunæ. Nearly everywhere, except in the narrow peripheral
area just mentioned, it is easy to recognise the bony laminæ
arranged in Haversian systems round the canals; and most of the lacunæ
between these laminæ are excessively elongated, with very numerous
branching canaliculi, which extend at right angles to their longer axis.
Near the margin of the ossicle, especially in its more translucent parts, the
bone-lacunæ are less elongated, more irregular in shape, and apparently
not arranged in any definite order. There is no clear evidence of
bony laminæ concentric with the outer margin, though appearances
are sometimes suggestive of this arrangement. A vertical section of an
ossicle presents exactly the same features as the horizontal section now
described. It is thus evident that the vascular canals with their Haversian
systems of bone have no definite direction, but are disposed in an
entirely irregular manner.</p>

<p>Taking into consideration all characters, and making comparisons
with the aid of my friend Mr. W. E. de Winton, I am inclined to regard
the fragmentary specimen as the skin of the neck and shoulder-region
with part of the left cheek. The apparent bilateral symmetry between at
least part of the thickened anterior outer angles of the specimen has
already been noted; and if this observation be well founded, the middle line
of the back extends vertically down the middle of the photograph, <a href="#i_408">p. 306</a>.
If the rounded notch above B be the base of the external ear, as seems
probable, the thick wrinkled skin (C) with fine short hair still further to
the left must be the cheek. The ear and cheek on the right side have
been removed; but at the base of the outwardly-turned angle on this side
of the specimen there are the very long hairs which occupy a similar
position on the left. It thus seems possible to estimate the transverse
measurement between the ears as from 0.25 m. to 0.30 m., which corresponds
with a tentative estimate of the same distance in <i>Mylodon robustus</i>
based on a skull in the British Museum.</p>

<h4>(b) <i>Comparisons and General Conclusions.</i></h4>

<p>The skin now described differs from that of all known terrestrial
Mammalia, except certain Edentata, in the presence of a bony dermal
armour. There can therefore be little doubt that the specimen has been
rightly referred to a member of this typically South American order.
Even among the Edentates, however, the fragment now under consideration
is unique in one respect; for all the ossicles are buried deeply in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
lower half of the thickened dermis and the hairs are implanted in every
part of its upper half, whereas all the forms of bony armour hitherto
described in this order reach the outer surface of the dermis and are
merely invested with horny epidermis. This is the case, as is well known,
in the common existing Armadillos, in which the hair is only implanted
in the dermis between the separate parts of the armour. Even in the
unique and remarkable skin of an Armadillo from Northern Brazil,
described by Milne-Edwards under the name of <i>Scleropleura bruneti</i><a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
the bony plates and tubercles are still covered only by epidermis, although
most of them are reduced to small nodules and might well have sunk
more deeply into the abnormally hairy skin. There is also reason to
believe that in the gigantic extinct Armadillos of the family Glyptodontidæ
the same arrangement of dermal structures prevailed; for one specimen
of <i>Panochthus tuberculatus</i> obtained by Dr. Moreno for the La Plata
Museum actually shows the dried horny epidermis in direct contact with
the underlying bone, and seems to prove that the numerous perforations
in the Glyptodont dermal armour were not for the implantation of hairs
(as once supposed), but for the passage of blood-vessels to the base of the
epidermal layer. Similarly, among the extinct Ground-Sloths of the
family Mylodontidæ dermal ossicles have been found with the remains of
<i>C&oelig;lodon</i><a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and various forms (perhaps different subgenera) of <i>Mylodon</i>;
but the only examples of this armour yet definitely described<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> exhibit a
conspicuously sculptured outer flattened face, and it thus seems clear that
Burmeister was correct in describing them as originally reaching the upper
surface of the dermis and only covered externally by a thickened epidermis.
It is, however, to be noted that Burmeister himself actually observed
armour of this kind covering only the lumbar region of the trunk. He
believed that the other parts of the animal were similarly armoured, because
he had found "the same ossicles" on the digits of the manus, where they
were "generally smaller and more spherical"; but he unfortunately omits
to make any explicit statement as to the presence or absence of the
characteristic external ornamentation on the latter.</p>

<p>The omission just mentioned is especially unfortunate, because on
careful comparison it is evident that the irregular disposition of the small
ossicles in the piece of skin now under consideration is most closely
paralleled in the dermal armour of the extinct <i>Mylodon</i>, as already
observed by Drs. Moreno and Ameghino. There is obviously no approach
in this specimen to the definite and symmetrical arrangement of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
armour such as is exhibited both by the existing Armadillos and the
extinct Glyptodonts. There are, then, two possibilities. Either the
dermal armour of <i>Mylodon</i> varied in different parts of the body, being
sculptured and covered only by epidermis in the lumbar region, while
less developed, not sculptured but completely buried in the dermis in the
comparatively flexible neck and shoulder region&mdash;in which case Dr. Moreno
may be correct in referring the problematical specimen to <i>Mylodon</i>; or
the dermal ossicles of this extinct genus may have been uniform throughout,
only differing in size and sparseness or compactness&mdash;in which case
Dr. Ameghino is justified in proposing to recognise a distinct genus,
<i>Neomylodon</i>.</p>

<p>To decide between these two possibilities, it is necessary to wait for
additional information concerning the anterior dorsal armour of <i>Mylodon</i>
as precise as that published by Burmeister in reference to the lumbar
shield. Meanwhile it must suffice to compare the microscopical structure
of the ossicles from the new skin with that of the small sculptured tubercles
of undoubted <i>Mylodon</i>. It must be remembered that the specimen has
been buried in the Pampa Formation for a long period, and that the
oxides of iron and manganese have infiltrated the margin of the bone,
rendering the structure of its outer border more conspicuous than that of
its central portion. It must also be noted that some of the manganese
has assumed its familiar "dendritic" aspect, in this respect presenting
appearances not due to original structure. The calcified interlacing fibres
of connective tissue are as abundant here as in the ossicle of the so-called
<i>Neomylodon</i>; but in a very wide peripheral area they exhibit a marked
radial disposition, nearly everywhere extending in bundles at right angles
to the border. Rather large vascular canals, infiltrated with the oxides
of iron and manganese, are observed in places, often bifurcated and usually
bordered by a transparent zone free from the connective-tissue fibres.
Well-developed bone-lacunæ are very abundant, many exhibiting short
branching canaliculi, and most of the others very irregular in shape,
evidently furnished with canaliculi which cannot be seen from lack of
infiltration. The lacunæ are never much elongated, and are not arranged
in distinctly differentiated Haversian systems in any part of the section;
while the only regular disposition of the bony laminæ is traceable near
the circumference, where the lacunæ are frequently arranged or clustered
in parallel zones concentric with the border. A vertical section of one
of the same specimens shows the connective-tissue fibres radiating outwards
towards the lateral margins, but not directly towards the upper
sculptured face. There are no bony laminæ clearly parallel with the
latter face, and at least one vascular canal in transverse section seems to
be the centre of a Haversian system.</p>

<p>The histological structure of the ossicles in the skin now under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
consideration thus resembles that of the sculptured tubercles of <i>Mylodon</i>
in all essential features, but differs in two noteworthy respects. In the
ossicles of the so-called <i>Neomylodon</i>, as already described, the fibres of
connective tissue do not exhibit much definite radiation towards the lateral
margin; while the bony tissue at most points is disposed in definite
Haversian systems. There is thus enough discrepancy to justify the
suspicion that the new and the old specimens do not belong to the same
animal. In fact, so far as the differentiation of the dermal bone is concerned,
the so-called <i>Neomylodon</i> is precisely intermediate between <i>Mylodon</i>
and the existing Armadillo (<i>Dasypus</i>); sections of the scutes of the latter
animal, both in the Royal College of Surgeons and in the British Museum,
showing that in this genus nearly the whole of the osseous tissue is
arranged in Haversian systems, although abundant interlacing connective-tissue
fibres are still entangled in it, at least near the border.</p>

<p>If the characteristic dermal armature does not suffice for the definite
expression of an opinion as to the precise affinities of the specimen, a still
less satisfactory result can be expected from a comparison of the hair.
For, in the first place, no hair has hitherto been discovered in association
with the skeleton of any extinct Ground-Sloth; while, secondly, the hairy
covering of a mammal is perhaps that part of its organisation most readily
adapted to the immediate circumstances of its life. So far as their endo-skeleton
is concerned, the extinct Mylodonts and their allies are precisely
intermediate between the existing Sloths and Anteaters; they combine
"the head and dentition of the former with the structure of the vertebral
column, limbs, and tail of the latter."<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> It might therefore be supposed
that the hair of this extinct group would exhibit some of the peculiarities
of that in one or other of its nearest surviving relatives. The epidermal
covering of the piece of skin now described, however, entirely lacks the
under-fur which is so thick in the Sloths; while the structure of each
individual hair, with its smooth cuticle and lack of a medulla, is strikingly
different from that observed both in the Sloths and Anteaters, and identical
with that of the hair in the surviving Armadillos. The large hair in the
Sloths and <i>Tamandua</i> exhibits a conspicuously scaly cuticle; while that
of <i>Myrmecophaga</i> is remarkable for its very large medulla. All these
animals now live in the tropics, either in forests or swamps, whereas the
Patagonian animal must have existed under circumstances much like
those under which the Armadillos still survive. Hence the characters
of the hair of the so-called <i>Neomylodon</i> may be of no great importance in
determining the affinities of the animal, but may represent a special
adaptation to its immediate environment.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the question of the antiquity of the problematical
skin. On two occasions I have examined the mummified remains of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
extinct Mammoth and Rhinoceros from Siberia in the Imperial Academy
of Sciences at St. Petersburg; I have also carefully studied the remains
of the neck and legs of the Moa from a cavern in New Zealand, now in
the British Museum. Compared with these shrivelled and dried specimens,
the piece of skin from Patagonia has a remarkably fresh and modern
aspect; and I should unhesitatingly express the opinion that it belonged
to an animal killed shortly before Dr. Moreno recognised its interest, had
he not been able to give so circumstantial an account of its discovery and
strengthened his point of view by recording the occurrence of a human
mummy of an extinct race in another cavern in the same district. The
presence of an abundant covering of dried serum on one cut border of the
skin is alone suggestive of grave doubts as to the antiquity of the specimen;
but Dr. Vaughan Harley tells me that similar dried serum has
been observed several times among the remains of the Egyptian mummies,
and there seems thus to be no limit to the length of time for which it can
be preserved, provided it is removed from all contact with moisture. I
may add that I have searched in vain in the writings of Ramon Lista
(so far as they are represented in the Library of the Royal Geographical
Society) for some reference to the statement which the late traveller made
verbally to Dr. Ameghino; and as the piece of skin now described
certainly represents an animal almost gigantic in size compared with the
Old-World Pangolin, I fear it cannot be claimed to belong to Lista's
problematical quadruped, whatever that may prove to be.</p>

<p>The final result of these brief considerations is therefore rather disappointing.
There are difficulties in either of the two possible hypotheses.
We have a piece of skin quite large enough to have belonged to the
extinct <i>Mylodon</i>; but unfortunately it cannot be directly compared with
the dermal armour of that genus, because it seems to belong to the neck-region,
while the only dermal tubercles of a Mylodont hitherto definitely
made known are referable to the lumbar region. If it does belong to
<i>Mylodon</i>, as Dr. Moreno maintains, it implies either that this genus
survived in Patagonia to a comparatively recent date, or that the circumstances
of preservation were unique in the cavern where the specimen was
discovered. On the other hand, if it belongs to a distinct and existing
genus, as Dr. Ameghino maintains&mdash;and as most of the characters of the
specimen itself would at first sight suggest&mdash;it is indeed strange that so
large and remarkable a quadruped should have hitherto escaped detection
in a country which has been so frequently visited by scientific explorers.</p>

<p class="p2">[P.S.&mdash;At the reading of this paper Prof. Ray Lankester remarked
that he should regard the characters of the hair as specially important,
and would not be surprised if the problematical piece of skin proved to
belong to an unknown type of Armadillo. This possibility had occurred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
to me, but I had hesitated to mention it on account of the considerable
discrepancy observable between the arrangement of the bony armour in
<i>Neomylodon</i> and that in the known Glyptodonts and the unique Brazilian
Armadillo (<i>Scleropleura</i>), which happen to exhibit an incompletely
developed (incipient or vestigial) shield. In each of the latter cases, the
armour is not subdivided into a compact mass of irregular ossicles, but
consists of well-separated elements which could only become continuous
by the addition of a considerable extent of bone round their margins, or
by the special development of smaller intervening ossicles.</p>

<p>Since the paper was read, I have had the privilege of studying Dr.
Einar Lönnberg's valuable description of the pieces of the problematical
skin mentioned by Dr. Moreno as having been taken to Upsala by Dr.
Otto Nordenskjöld.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> It appears that with the skin was found the
epidermal sheath of a large unknown claw, which may have belonged to
the same animal. This specimen proves to be different from that of any
existing Sloth, Anteater, or Armadillo, and is considered by Dr. Lönnberg
to belong probably to the hind foot of a Mylodont, which did not walk
on the exterior, lateral surfaces of the toes to the same extent as <i>Mylodon</i>.
In a section of the skin provisionally ascribed to the leg, he observes that
the small ossicles are very irregular, and shows two instances in which two
are placed one above the other. In microscopical sections of the ossicles,
however, he does not find the distinct Haversian systems of bone so conspicuous
in my slides; and hence he fails to remark the differences
between the structure of the armour in <i>Neomylodon</i> and <i>Mylodon</i>, which
seem to me to be particularly noteworthy. His so-called "pigment
cellules" in <i>Mylodon</i> are the dendritic infiltrations of oxide of manganese
and stains of oxide of iron, to which I have made special reference. His
observations as to the absence of a medulla in the hair confirm my own;
but I have not seen any evidence of the suspected loss or disintegration
of the hair-cuticle. Finally, Dr. Lönnberg has boiled a piece of the skin,
thereby extracting glue, "which proves that the collagen and gelatinous
substances are perfectly preserved." The latter observation confirms the
evidence of the serum recorded above, and indicates that if the specimen
is "of any considerable age, it must have been very well protected against
moisture and bacteria."&mdash;A. S. W.]

<h3>III. <span class="smcap">Description of Additional Discoveries.</span><br />
By <span class="smcap">A. Smith Woodward</span>.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></h3>

<p>Last February, when presenting to the Zoological Society an account
of the skin of a Ground-Sloth discovered in a cavern in Southern
Patagonia, Dr. Moreno mentioned that further excavations were being
made in the hope of finding other remains of the same animal. The
task referred to was undertaken by Dr. Rudolph Hauthal, geologist of the
La Plata Museum, who met with complete success.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> He not only found
another piece of skin, but also various broken bones of more than one
individual of a large species of Ground-Sloth in a remarkably fresh state
of preservation. Moreover, he discovered teeth of an extinct horse and
portions of limb-bones of a large feline carnivore, in association with
these remains; he likewise met with traces of fire, which clearly occurred
in the same deposits as the so-called <i>Neomylodon</i>. All these remains
were found beneath the dry earth on the floor of an enormous chamber
which seemed to have been artificially enclosed by rude walls. In one
spot they were scattered through a thick deposit of excrement of some
gigantic herbivore, evidently the Ground-Sloth itself; in another spot
they were associated with an extensive accumulation of cut hay. Dr.
Hauthal and his colleagues, indeed, concluded that the cavern was an
old corral in which the Ground-Sloths had been kept and fed by man.</p>

<p>As the result of these explorations, Dr. Moreno has now the gratification
of exhibiting to the Society complete proof that the piece of skin
described on the former occasion belongs to a genuine Pampean Ground-Sloth,
not <i>Mylodon</i> itself, but a very closely related genus <i>Grypotherium</i>,
of which skulls are already known from Pampean deposits in the Province
of Buenos Aires.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The collection which we now have the privilege of
examining distinctly supports his contention that the large quadruped in
question belongs to an extinct fauna, though contemporary with man.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
The discovery is thus unique in the history of palæontology, on account
of the remarkably fresh state of preservation of all the remains. Some of
the new specimens exhibit no indication whatever of having been buried.
Many of the bones retain their original whitish colour, apparently without
any loss of gelatine; while both these and other bones, which have
evidently been entombed in brownish dust, bear numerous remnants
not only of the dried periosteum, but also of shrivelled muscles, ligaments,
and cartilages. Very few of the bones are fossilised, in the ordinary sense
of the term.</p>

<p>An admirable brief description of this collection has already been published
(<i>op. cit.</i>) by Dr. Roth, who was the first to recognise the generic
identity of <i>Neomylodon</i> with <i>Grypotherium</i>. Some of the specimens, however,
are worthy of a more detailed examination; and Dr. Moreno
has kindly entrusted them to me for study in connection with the
collections in the British Museum and the Royal College of Surgeons.
The following notes, supplementing Dr. Roth's original memoir, are
the result of this further investigation.</p>

<h4>1. <span class="smcap">Remains of <i>Grypothrium listai</i>.</span></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Number of Individuals.</i></p>

<p>Among the fragmentary bones of the Ground-Sloth, it is easy to
recognise evidence of three individuals, which do not differ much in size.
There are three distinct examples of the occiput and fragments of the
dentigerous portion of three mandibles. It is also noteworthy that the
three malar bones preserved are all different in shape, while three
corresponding fragments of the acromial process of the scapula differ in
size. One portion of maxilla seems to represent a fourth individual,
being probably too small for either of the skulls to which the occiputs
belong. Finally, as Dr. Roth has pointed out, one shaft of a humerus,
which appears to be the bone of an adult, belongs to a much smaller
animal than is indicated by any other specimen in the collection.</p>

<p>Remains of three individuals are thus recognisable with certainty; two
others can probably be distinguished; while some of the fragments may
even belong to a sixth specimen. It must also be noted that other
portions of jaws are said to have been discovered by E. Nordenskjöld.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Skull and Mandible.</i></p>

<p>The largest portion of cranium (No. 1) is not stained in any way, and
does not retain a trace of the material in which it was buried in any
hollow or crevice. It does not appear to have been damaged during
excavation, but exhibits fractures which were almost certainly made when
the animal was freshly killed. The cranial roof near the occipital region
is battered in four places, though the injuries do not affect the brain-case
itself; while the right occipital condyle is partly removed by a sharp,
clean cut. There can, indeed, be no doubt that the animal was killed
and cut to pieces by man.</p>

<p>This skull is evidently that of an adult animal, all the sutures in the
hinder region being closed. The inner wall of the temporal fossa is much
flattened, without any irregular convexities, but marked with the characteristic
reticulately-decussating, fine ridges of bone, and studded with
adherent patches of muscle-fibre. The upper border of the fossa is a
remarkably sharp edge, while the narrow flattened cranial roof is only
marked by a faint longitudinal median furrow and by a diminutive tuft of
fibre in a small median pit near the occipital edge.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The fractures
exhibit the very large cancellated chambers surrounding the brain-case
dorso-laterally; while a median longitudinal section shows both these
cells and others in the basi-sphenoid. The basi-cranial axis is nearly
straight, inclining a little upwards in front. The anterior condyloid
foramina piercing the basi-occipital are remarkably large, as usual; the
basi-sphenoid is very long and narrow, flattened mesially on its lower face,
but with one slight median prominence near its hinder end; the pre-sphenoid
forms a short acute rostrum, above which there are remains
of the vomer. The hinder ends of the pterygoids are shown to be
inflated with large cancellæ, but the sides of the base of the skull are
somewhat obscured by the dried soft parts. The mastoid process of the
periotic, with its articular facette for the stylohyal, seems to be rather
smaller than in <i>Mylodon</i>. The tympanic bone is preserved on the right
side, though wanting on the left. It is an irregular curved plate only
slightly bullate, but forming a complete floor to the tympanic cavity.
As usual in Edentata, it is not produced into an auditory meatus.</p>

<p>The right maxilla (No. 4) is in precisely the same state of preservation
as the specimen just described, and probably belongs to the same skull.
Its anterior margin is perfectly preserved, indicating that the facial
region is very short in front of the anterior end of the zygomatic
arch, which is pierced by a rather large suborbital canal. Its upper
border proves that the nasal region was raised into a slightly convex
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
dome; while its antero-superior angle is not rounded as in <i>Mylodon</i>, but
curves upwards and forwards and ends in a point as in <i>Grypotherium</i>. At
the oral border there are the shattered bases of four teeth.</p>

<p>A fragment of the nasal region (No. 13) may also have belonged
to the same skull, but its state of preservation is a little different from that
of the two specimens just described. It has clearly been buried in a
powdery deposit, which has stained it brown; but the enveloping dust
must have been extremely dry, for fragments of cartilage adhere to it,
as well preserved as in the nasal chamber of the cranium itself (No. 1).
It also bears traces of the integument.</p>

<p>Judging by the figures of the skull of <i>Grypotherium</i> published by
Reinhardt (<i>loc. cit.</i>), this specimen seems to have occupied an anterior
position in the nasal region. It is thus of great interest, because the
three known skulls of <i>Grypotherium</i> leave the precise nature of the
bony arcade separating the narial openings undecided. According
to Reinhardt, the nasal bones terminate as in <i>Mylodon</i>, and the arcade
is an element interposed between them and the premaxillæ. According
to Burmeister, the nasals themselves extend forwards and constitute
the greater part, if not the whole, of the problematical bar. The
fragment now under consideration is clearly in favour of the latter interpretation.
Its lower thickened end is a massive bone, not bilaterally
symmetrical, and not showing any trace of a median suture. Its inferior
face is irregular and roughened, and can scarcely be regarded as an
articular facette. Its upper portion consists of a pair of bones separated
by a very well-marked median longitudinal suture. These are
not thickened at their contracted upper end, where they have evidently
been broken, and are not quite bilaterally symmetrical. They doubtless
fuse at their lower end with the problematical azygous bone already
mentioned, but the arrangement is obscured by the enveloping soft parts.
A pair of bones, which may be regarded as nasals, thus extend forwards
in a narrow arch to a point just above the anterior end of the premaxillæ;
while the massive bone effecting a union between the two normal pairs
of elements is probably an ossification in the internasal septum. It is
interesting to note that there is an incipient trace of a similar forward
production of the nasals in the genus <i>Scelidotherium</i>; while there is
sometimes an ossification of the internasal septum in <i>Megatherium</i>.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>The three specimens now described, when placed approximately in
their natural positions, afford a very satisfactory idea of the form and
proportions of the skull when complete. The malar bone is the only
important part to be added; but unfortunately it is impossible to decide
which of the three specimens of this element in the collection belongs to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
the individual now under consideration. As already mentioned, these
three bones are all different in the shape and proportions of the hinder
bifurcated end. They are all very fresh in appearance, but have been
stained reddish-brown by the earth in which they must have been buried.</p>

<p>The hinder portion of the second skull already mentioned (No. 2)
comprises the occiput and brain-case as far forward as the front of the
cerebral hemispheres. It is much battered and broken, and in quite as
fresh a state as the cranium already described, with a considerable investment
of dried soft parts on its base. It is only very slightly smaller than
No. 1, but is of interest as exhibiting some of the sutures, besides a
roundness and smoothness indicative of immaturity. The supraoccipital
is shown to be very large; a small median point of it enters the foramen
magnum, while the suture separating it from the parietals and squamosals
extends along the rounded lambdoidal ridge. The horizontally extended
suture between the squamosal and parietal on the inner wall of the
temporal fossa is seen in the position where Owen determined it to occur
in <i>Mylodon</i>.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Both tympanics are preserved, but they are more obscured
by soft parts than in No. 1.</p>

<p>To this cranium probably belongs a detached portion of the left side
of the facial region (No. 5), in a similar state of preservation and
slightly smaller than the maxilla (No. 4). The suture between the
frontal and the maxilla still persists, while the oral border is preserved
farther forward than in the last-mentioned specimen, showing a fragment
of the much-reduced premaxilla united with the maxilla by a jagged
suture.</p>

<p>The third imperfect occiput is about as large as the immature
specimen No. 2, but does not exhibit any features worthy of special
note.</p>

<p>The largest and most important portions of the mandible are Nos. 9
and 11, which evidently belong to the right and left rami of one and the
same jaw. They are much broken and are in the same fresh condition
as the skulls, with traces of the periosteum and even considerable
portions of the soft parts of the gum. The right ramus is preserved
sufficiently far forwards to show that there was no caniniform tooth in
front of the series of four ordinary molars. Judging by the extent of
the latter series, the specimen probably belongs to the same individual as
the skull No. 1.</p>

<p>Another portion of a mandibular ramus (No. 10) of the left side is
slightly smaller than the last and may well have belonged to the immature
individual No. 2. It is similarly quite fresh in appearance, and bears
the shrivelled remains of the gum. It is interesting as exhibiting the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
two posterior molars slightly different in shape from those of the former
mandible. In this specimen the longer axis of the third molar is oblique,
whereas in No. 9 it is coincident with the axis of the mandible; while in
the former the fourth molar is not so long in proportion to its width as in
the latter. Such slight differences, however, cannot be regarded in the
Edentata as more than individual variations.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Brain-cavity and Cerebral Nerves.</i></p>

<p>By the kind permission of Dr. Moreno, the cranium No. 1 has
been vertically bisected to display the character of the cranial cavity
and the nerve-foramina. An instructive plaster-cast of the cavity
has thus been made by Mr. C. Barlow, the Formatore of the British
Museum.</p>

<p>The olfactory lobes are shown to have been well developed, projecting
a little in front of the cerebral hemispheres. These hemispheres
are together somewhat longer than broad, slightly broader behind
than in front, and a little constricted in the middle. They do not overlap
the cerebellum, which is relatively large. The origins of the nerves
are very imperfectly shown in the cast; only their exits from the cranial
cavity are clear. The most interesting are the optic and trigeminal nerves,
which pass out of the cranial cavity at first by a common exit, which is
soon subdivided by a bony partition into two canals, the former no less
than 0.08 m., the latter 0.045 m. in length. The fourth, seventh, eighth
and twelfth nerves are also recognisable on the cast; and one prominence
of plaster has filled the foramen lacerum posterius.</p>

<p>Compared with the brains of <i>Mylodon</i> and <i>Scelidotherium</i>, so far as
known from casts of the cranial cavity,<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> that of <i>Grypotherium</i> is observed
to be more elongated, with less divergent and prominent olfactory lobes,
less constricted cerebral hemispheres, and a larger cerebellum. In the
form and proportions of the cerebrum and cerebellum, it similarly differs
from <i>Megatherium</i>.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The cerebral hemispheres of the existing <i>Chol&oelig;pus
didactylus</i> and <i>Bradypus tridactylus</i><a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> are more tapering forward, and their
cerebellum is relatively smaller than in <i>Grypotherium</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Auditory Ossicles.</i></p>

<p>The auditory ossicles were preserved in the tympanic cavities of both
skulls, Nos. 1 and 2, being retained by the dried soft parts. They were
detected by Prof. Charles Stewart, who kindly extracted them, with great
skill, from both sides of each skull. Comparing these ossicles with the fine
collection in the Royal College of Surgeons, they prove to be closely similar
to those of all the existing Sloths, but most nearly resembling those of
<i>Chol&oelig;pus didactylus</i>. The malleus is bent exactly as in the latter species,
and is of similar shape. As observed by Prof. Stewart, it is remarkable
in articulating with the incus not only by the head, but also by a diminutive
lower facet, which is in contact with a small facetted process on the
anterior arm of the incus. A feeble indication of the same secondary
articulation is also observable in <i>Chol&oelig;pus</i>; but it is curiously absent in
the second specimen of <i>Grypotherium</i>. The two divergent arms of the
incus are equal in length, as usual in the Sloths. The stapes is only
very slightly perforated in both specimens; while a small circular disc
firmly fixed to the incus represents the orbicular bone in the second skull.
The auditory ossicles of <i>Grypotherium</i>, therefore, are very different from
those of <i>Myrmecophaga</i>, in which the malleus is less sharply bent, the
incus has divergent arms of unequal length, and the stapes exhibits a large
perforation.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p class="center"><i>Vertebræ and Limb-bones.</i></p>

<p>Nearly all the remains of vertebræ and limb-bones are in the same
state of preservation as the portions of skull and mandible already
described, with adherent cartilage and traces of muscles and ligaments.
With some of the ungual phalanges there are also well-preserved examples
of the epidermal sheath. As already remarked by Roth, the edges of
one sheath probably belonging to the fourth digit of the manus, are
quite sharp, and indicate that if the animal walked on its fore feet it
resembled <i>Myrmecophaga</i> in the peculiar twist of the manus.</p>

<p>All the specimens in this series seem to have been accurately determined
and sufficiently described by Roth. It is only necessary to
emphasise the fact that the two shafts of humerus with abraded, not
sharply broken, ends have a much more fossilised appearance than any
other specimen in the collection, and are deeply stained throughout by
ferruginous matter. The small shaft, No. 22, certainly seems to have
belonged to an adult animal, as remarked by Roth, and it was probably
much smaller than any individual indicated by the other remains.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Skin and Hair.</i></p>

<p>The new piece of skin, which is stated by Hauthal to have been
found in the deposit of excrement, is not quite so well preserved as the
original piece. It is much folded in an irregular manner; and the hair,
which is yellower than in the previous specimen, is preserved only in
patches on the outer face. It must have been stripped from the body of
the animal by man; but the only distinct marks of tools, which were
evidently made when the skin was fresh, are a few indents and small pits
on the outer face. The indents must have been made by oblique thrusts
of a stick, or a small, blunt, chisel-shaped instrument. The small pittings
are nearer the middle of the specimen and less conspicuous. A vacuity
in the skin seems to be due to accidental tearing or to a thrust after it
was dry: it may even have been caused by the fallen blocks of stone
found lying upon it.</p>

<p>The specimen, as preserved, measures about a metre across in one
direction by 93 centimetres in another direction. As already observed
by Roth, its irregular folding makes the determination of its position on
the trunk very difficult; but I am convinced that its state of preservation
is not sufficiently good to justify an attempt to unfold the skin by the
ordinary method of steaming. Taking all facts into consideration, Roth
seems to be correct in ascribing it to the right flank and the postero-superior
part of one of the limbs. It most probably belongs to the fore
limb, as Roth supposes; but there is no clear proof that it is not referable
to the hind-quarters.</p>

<p>The original situation of the piece of skin being thus determined, it is
interesting to observe the disposition of the ossicles in the lower layer.
Owing to abrasion, contraction, and partial disintegration, they are conspicuous
in most parts of the specimen. They are very irregular in shape
and size, and closely compacted together, as in the previous specimen.
It is, however, to be noted that in some parts there is a distinct tendency
to arrangement in regular, straight, parallel rows. The long axes of the
elongated ossicles are nearly always coincident with the direction of these
rows. They are especially well shown on the middle of the flank; and,
as might be expected, the rows are here disposed vertically, parallel with
the ribs.</p>

<p>In some parts of the skin the ossicles are exposed on their outer face;
but appearances render it almost certain that this exposure is due to the
disintegration and abrasion of the specimen. In one patch thus uncovered
by the removal of the soft parts, the ossicles are seen to form a closely
arranged, flattened pavement; and their outer face is much more conspicuously
marked by pittings than that of any ossicle extracted from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
first discovered piece of skin. In fact, as Roth remarks, the pitting is
here quite similar to that observable on many ossicles dug up in association
with the fossil skeletons of <i>Mylodon</i>; though it does not form so
regular a reticulate pattern as that of the dermal ossicles of <i>Mylodon</i>
in the British Museum figured on the former occasion.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Another interesting feature of the new piece of skin consists in the
dwindling and even total absence of the ossicles towards the ventral
border. A section along the edge exhibits only two diminutive nodules
of bone in a length of 0.1 m.; while another similar section taken
vertically from the skin of the limb shows no trace of ossicles, except
perhaps two little specks. It must, however, be noted that the limb
was not entirely destitute of armour; for on the border the bones are as
well developed and conspicuous as on the middle of the flank. In the
newly-cut sections the skin has a translucent aspect, showing that it is
merely dried and not tanned in any way.</p>

<p>The hair on the new specimen varies in length from 0.07 m. or
0.10 m. to 0.15 m. or 0.22 m. It is thus longer than that of the
previous piece of skin. Masses of still longer hairs&mdash;some 0.30 m.
in length&mdash;were found detached among the excrement, and these are
also believed by Roth to belong to the same animal. His determination
is probably correct; for, when examined microscopically, these long
hairs are observed to have a perfectly smooth cuticle, while some transverse
sections (kindly made by Mr. R. H. Burne) demonstrate the complete
absence of a medulla, exactly as in the short hairs. The latter
feature proves that they cannot be referred either to the horse or to
the guanaco.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Excrement.</i></p>

<p>The large cylindrical pieces of excrement, which may be referred to
<i>Grypotherium</i> without any hesitation, have already been described and
figured by Dr. Roth. They consist of irregular discoids of herbaceous
matter closely pressed together, the largest measuring no less than 0.18 m.
in diameter. Mr. Spencer Moore has kindly examined them from the
botanist's point of view and reports that they are composed "in large
part apparently of grasses, as the haulms, leaf-sheaths, fragments of
leaves, &amp;c., of these plants are frequent in the mass. A spikelet, almost
entire, of what seems to be a species of <i>Poa</i>, and the flowering glume of
another grass, probably avenaceous, have also been found. Besides these
there are at least two dicotyledonous plants, one herbaceous and the
other almost certainly so, the latter having a slender greatly sclerotised
stem. Unfortunately, as no leaves have hitherto been observed attached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
to the fragments of stem, their affinities are altogether doubtful. There
are numerous silicious particles in the excrement, and there are many
pieces of the underground parts of the plants, suggesting that they have
been pulled out of the ground. A few pieces of stems are sharply cut,
not bruised or torn at the end." The latter fact is especially important
in connection with Dr. Hauthal's discovery of cut hay in the cavern,
and his theory that the <i>Grypotherium</i> was kept in captivity and fed
by man.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Generic and Specific Determination.</i></p>

<p>The fortunate discovery of all parts of the skull and dentition renders
the generic determination of this Ground-Sloth now quite certain. The
teeth show that it belongs to the family Mylodontidæ; the presence
of only four instead of five upper molars separates it from the genera
<i>Mylodon</i>, <i>Lestodon</i>, and <i>Scelidotherium</i>; the forward production of the
nasals and the ossification of part of the internarial septum place it
definitely in the allied genus <i>Grypotherium</i>, as originally diagnosed by
Reinhardt. The only question needing consideration is, whether the fragment
of cranium described by Owen in 1840 as the type of the genus
<i>Glossotherium</i><a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> is really identical with that subsequently described by
Reinhardt under the name of <i>Grypotherium darwini</i>, as now seems to be
commonly believed.</p>

<p>Darwin's original specimen, on which the genus <i>Glossotherium</i> of Owen
was founded, is preserved in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.
It has thus been possible to compare it directly with the undoubted
cranium of <i>Grypotherium</i> from the Patagonian cavern. The specimen is
merely the left half of the hinder part of the cranium, and is therefore very
inadequate for discussion; but several features seem worthy of note. Compared
with the new skull No. 1, the fragment named <i>Glossotherium</i> has
(i.) the inner wall of the temporal fossa less flattened, (ii.) the digastric
fossa deeper in proportion to its width, (iii.) the hinder border of the inflated
pterygoid vertical, instead of sloping downwards and forwards, (iv.) a
much larger and deeper pit for the articulation of the stylohyal, and (v.) a
longer canal penetrating the base of the occipital condyle for the passage
of the hypoglossal nerve. In all these respects the so-called <i>Glossotherium</i>
agrees much more closely with the typical <i>Mylodon</i>; and Owen was probably
correct in 1842 when he expressed the opinion that the two are at
least generically identical.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span></p>

<p>I am therefore of opinion that <i>Grypotherium</i> is the correct generic
name for the Ground-Sloth from the Patagonian cavern, while <i>Glossotherium</i>
must be relegated to the synonymy of <i>Mylodon</i>.</p>

<p>The specific determination of the new specimens is more difficult. As
remarked by Roth, only two species of <i>Grypotherium</i> seem to be already
known from the Pampa formation&mdash;<i>G. darwini</i> by three skulls<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and
<i>G. bonaerense</i> solely by a maxilla.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The portions of skull and dentition
now under discussion indicate an animal much larger than <i>G. bonaerense</i>
(assuming the original maxilla to be that of an adult); while they are considerably
smaller than any known specimen of <i>G. darwini</i>. Moreover, the
nasal arcade now described is narrower and more concave on its outer face
than that of <i>G. darwini</i>, as already observed by Roth. It thus seems
very probable that the animal from the Patagonian cavern represents
a distinct species, which must bear the name of <i>G. listai</i>. This specific
name was given by Ameghino to a fragment of the first-discovered piece of
skin, and the curious argument which leads Roth to propose the substitution
of a new name for it does not affect its validity.</p>

<p>It may be added that Dr. Erland Nordenskjöld has recently compared
his specimens from the Patagonian cavern with the skull of <i>Grypotherium
darwini</i> at Copenhagen, and finds no specific difference.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> No particulars
however, have yet been published.</p>

<h4>2. <span class="smcap">Associated Mammalian Remains.</span></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Felis</i>, sp.</p>

<p>A feline carnivore larger than the existing Jaguar (<i>Felis onca</i>), but
about the same size as an average Tiger (<i>F. tigris</i>), is represented in
the collection by the distal half of a right humerus (No. 44), a left fourth
metatarsal (No. 46), and the distal end of another metatarsal (No. 47).
These bones have evidently been buried in dust, but are in the same fresh
state of preservation as those of <i>Grypotherium</i>.</p>

<p>Careful comparison of these bones shows that they are undoubtedly
feline; and there is no difficulty in determining that they belong to <i>Felis</i>
rather than to the extinct <i>Machærodus</i>. A humerus of <i>M. neogæus</i>, from a
Brazilian cavern, now in the British Museum (No. 18972 <i>b</i>), is readily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
distinguished from the new Patagonian humerus by the remarkable lateral
compression of its shaft and the much greater downward extension of its
prominent and sharp deltoid ridge. The humerus in all the large species
of <i>Felis</i>, on the other hand, only differs from the fossil now under discussion
in very small particulars. In fact, the humerus and metatarsals of
the existing <i>Felis onca</i> are essentially identical with the bones from the Patagonian
cavern, except that they are rather smaller. I am therefore
inclined to regard the newly discovered remains as indicating a comparatively
large variety of <i>F. onca</i>, which once lived in the temperate regions
of Patagonia, beyond the present range of this species. Such an occurrence
would be a precise parallel to that of the Cave-Lion in Europe. It
is well known that nearly all the remains of <i>F. leo</i> found in the Pleistocene
formations of the temperate parts of the Old World indicate animals
of somewhat larger size than any surviving in the warmer regions to which
the species is now confined.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>It may be noted that bones of the Jaguar of ordinary dimensions have
been recorded from the Pampa formation of the Province of Buenos
Aires.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p class="center"><i>Arctotherium</i>, sp.</p>

<p>With the bones of <i>Felis</i> just noticed, Roth provisionally associates
the imperfect distal end of a remarkably large right femur. He is
thus induced to suppose that the carnivore represented by the fragments
will prove to be a new genus and species of the Felidæ. He suggests
for it the name of <i>Iemisch listai</i>, on the assumption that it is the mysterious
quadruped which Ameghino states is known to the natives as the
Iemisch.</p>

<p>A comparison of the distal end of the femur in question with the femora
of Felidæ in the British Museum seems to prove conclusively that it
cannot be referred even to the same family. Its width across the condyles
is much greater, compared with its antero-posterior diameter, than that
observed in any feline. Moreover, the pit for the tendon of the popliteus
muscle below the external condyle is unusually deep. In both these
respects the bone closely resembles the distal end of the femur of a Bear.
I have been therefore led to compare it with the corresponding part of
the extinct Bear of the Pampean formation, <i>Arctotherium</i>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the fine and nearly complete skeleton of <i>Arctotherium
bonaerense</i> in the Bravard Collection in the British Museum comprises
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
the right femur and enables direct comparison to be made. The
fragment lacks the inner condyle; but enough of the trochlea remains
to show its broad and gently-rounded form, with a wide and deep
intertrochlear notch, precisely as in <i>Arctotherium</i>. It has the same
development of the external condyle as in the latter, while the fossa for
the popliteal tendon is equally deep, only slightly differing in shape. In
fact, there is very little discrepancy, except in its smaller size; and species
of <i>Arctotherium</i> smaller than <i>A. bonaerense</i> are already known both from
the Pampa formation of Argentina<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and the caverns of Brazil.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>The fragment just described has evidently been severed from the rest
of the bone by a sharp, clean cut made by man; and Dr. Hauthal is
quite certain that this was not done by one of his workmen during
excavation (<i>op. cit.</i> p. 59). At least one medium-sized species of
<i>Arctotherium</i> must therefore have survived until the human period in
Southern Patagonia.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p class="center"><i>Onohippidium saldiasi.</i></p>

<p>A horse is represented in the collection by an upper molar, a fragment
of premaxilla with two incisors, an imperfect atlas and two well-preserved
hoofs apparently of a f&oelig;tus or perhaps of a newly-born animal.
Of these remains only the upper molar is capable of satisfactory determination.</p>

<p>This tooth is the second upper molar of the left side, and has been
exhaustively compared with corresponding teeth by Dr. Roth, who gives
a good series of figures. It is readily distinguished from the homologous
molar in the genus <i>Equus</i> by the peculiar form of its two inner columns&mdash;a
fact which I have been able to verify by the examination of an
extensive series of specimens, both recent and fossil, in the British
Museum. Further comparison, indeed, shows that it must be referred to
the extinct Pampean genus <i>Onohippidium</i>.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Roth assigns it, apparently
quite rightly, to the same species as a maxilla from the Pampean
formation of the Province of Buenos Aires, for which he proposes the
name of <i>Onohippidium saldiasi</i>.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Large Extinct Rodent.</i></p>

<p>The proximal end of the femur of a large rodent has already been
recognised by Roth, and compared with the extinct <i>Megamys</i>. It cannot
be more exactly determined.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Existing Species.</i></p>

<p>One imperfect fragment of pelvis and sacrum seems to belong to
a puma (<i>Felis concolor</i>) of rather large size; but it is not sufficient for
precise determination.</p>

<p>The small mandibular ramus of a musteline referred by Dr. Roth
to <i>Mephitis suffocans</i>, does not pertain to this genus and species.
Mr. Oldfield Thomas determines it to belong to the rare <i>Lyncodon
patagonicus</i>, which still lives in Patagonia and has not hitherto been found
fossil. A slightly larger extinct species of the same genus has been
described by Ameghino on the evidence of a skull from the Pampean
formation near Lujan, in the Province of Buenos Aires.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>A cranium, some vertebræ, and a tibia and fibula appear to represent
the existing <i>Ctenomys magellanicus</i>, as noted by Roth.</p>

<p>The remains of the Guanaco (<i>Lama huanacos</i>) do not present any
features worthy of special remark.</p>

<p>Man is represented by a diseased scapula and by two bone awls, which
are clearly made from the tibia of a species of <i>Canis</i> intermediate in
size between <i>C. jubatus</i> and <i>C. magellanicus</i>.</p>

<h4>3. <span class="smcap">Relative Age of the Remains.</span></h4>

<p>As the result of Dr. Roth's researches, supplemented by the additional
observations now recorded, it is evident that the majority of the mammalian
remains from the cavern near Last Hope Inlet belong to the
extinct fauna which occurs in the Pampean formation of more northern
regions. To this category are referable the genera <i>Grypotherium</i>, <i>Onohippidium</i>,
<i>Megamys</i>, and <i>Arctotherium</i>; also <i>Macrauchenia</i>, which is said to
have been discovered in the same deposit on the floor of the cave by
Dr. E. Nordenskjöld. The large <i>Felis</i> likewise probably belongs to the
same series. Remains of mammals of the existing fauna, on the other
hand, are comparatively few and insignificant, referable to the genera
<i>Ctenomys</i>, <i>Cervus</i>, <i>Lama</i>, <i>Lyncodon</i>, and <i>Felis</i>.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span></p>

<p>Although Dr. Hauthal's explorations were rather hurried and Dr.
Nordenskjöld's results have only been published hitherto in abstract,<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
their account of the deposits on the floor of the cavern seem to confirm
the suspicion that the remains of these two faunas were introduced at two
successive periods. According to Hauthal, the remains of the Guanaco
were found along with fragmentary bones of Deer, shells of <i>Mytilus chorus</i>,
branches of trees, and dried leaves, in the superficial dust of the cavern
near the outer wall. The skin of <i>Grypotherium</i> and all the other remains
of this and the associated Pampean genera were discovered in the deeper
layer of excrement and cut hay between the mound and the inner wall of
the cavern. According to Nordenskjöld, three distinct strata can be
recognised on the floor of the cavern as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="hanging">A. A thin surface layer, containing ashes, shells, and bones of recent animals

<p>It is unfortunate that the question of the contemporaneity of the
various bones cannot be tested by the ingenious method of chemical
analysis which has been applied with success to similar problems by
M. Adolphe Carnot in France. The French chemist has shown that when
bones are buried in ordinary sediments they undergo changes which
gradually cause the percentage of contained fluorine to increase. According
to him, the longer a bone has been buried, the greater is the percentage
of fluorine found in it on analysis. In one case<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> he examined the scapula of
a deer and a human tibia, discovered together in fluviatile sand near Billancourt
(Seine); he found that the former had seven or eight times its usual
percentage of fluorine, while the human bone did not differ in any respect
from the normal in this constituent. He therefore concluded that the
latter bone was not of the same age as the former, but had been introduced
comparatively recently by burial. In this and the other recorded
cases, however, it is to be observed that the sediment was of a uniform
character and admitted of free percolation of water. In the Patagonian
cavern, on the contrary, the bones occur partly in dust, partly in dried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
herbage, partly in dried excrement, and partly in the burnt residue of the
same. Moreover, they must always have been subjected to intense dryness,
and the usual process of chemical alteration cannot have taken place.</p>

<p>Considering all circumstances, I think that, even without chemical
evidence, zoologists and geologists cannot fail now to agree with Dr.
Moreno and his colleagues of the La Plata Museum, that the remarkably
preserved <i>Grypotherium</i> from the Patagonian cavern belongs to the extinct
Pampean fauna of South America, and need not be searched for in the
unexplored wilds of that continent. If we accept the confirmatory
evidence afforded by Mr. Spencer Moore, we can also hardly refuse to
believe that this great Ground-Sloth was actually kept and fed by an
early race of man.</p>

<h3>IV. <span class="smcap">Note concerning Tehuelche Legends.</span></h3>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Hesketh Prichard</span>.</p>

<p>I now proceed to give the testimony of Dr. F. Ameghino, whose
brother Carlos was well acquainted with the country and who early
gave it as his opinion that the animal, which is named the <i>Neomylodon
listai</i>, was still living in Patagonia. In support of his opinion he
adduced tales which Carlos Ameghino had gathered from the Indians,
who roam the pampas, of a vast mysterious beast said by them to haunt
the distant lagoons and forests of the unexplored regions near the Andes.
These stories had, moreover, been confirmed in Dr. Ameghino's opinion by
the experience of the late well-known geographer and traveller, Señor
Ramon Lista, who verbally told both Dr. Ameghino and his brother that
he had seen and fired at a mysterious creature, which, however, disappeared
in the brushwood and could not afterwards be traced. He described it as
being covered with reddish-grey hair, and he believed it to be a pangolin
or scaly-anteater.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Taking all things into consideration, Dr. Ameghino
announced his conviction that the mysterious animal referred to was the last
representative of a group, long believed extinct, related to the Mylodon.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Ameghino the Indians had bestowed upon the
mysterious animal the name of Iemisch. Nothing would induce them to
penetrate into the supposed haunts of this monster. It was described as
amphibious, equally at home on land or in the water; in remote
mountain recesses it lurked in caves, or had its lairs by the shores of
lonely lagoons and rivers, or at times lay in wait among the lower passes
of the Cordillera. In habits it was nocturnal, and its strength so great
that it could seize a horse in its claws, and hold itself down to the
bottoms of the lakes! The head was supposed to be short and without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
external ears, but showing enormous dog-teeth: the feet short and bear-like,
armed with formidable claws united by a swimming membrane; the
long tail, tapering and prehensile, the hair hard and of a uniform yellowish-brown.
In size it far exceeded any creature they knew of, its legs,
though short, being almost as great in girth as its body. It followed,
naturally that narratives of personal experiences and encounters with
this terrific animal were varied.</p>

<p>These data, it must be confessed, were bewildering. In fact, as described
by the Indians the Iemisch was scientifically absurd; but the Indian is
like a child in many ways and would naturally endow a creature he feared
with extraordinary attributes.</p>

<p>I will quote here an extract from Winwood Reade's "Savage Africa,"
one of the finest books of travel ever written.</p>

<p>"It must be laid down as a general principle that man can originate
nothing; that lies are always truths embellished, distorted, or turned
inside out. There are other facts beside those which lie on the surface,
and it is the duty of the traveller and the historian to sift and wash the
gold-grains of truth from the dirt of fable.... It is true that some of
the ancient myths have been sobered down to natural beings. The men
with dogs' heads of whom Herodotus speaks are the barking baboons
which I saw in Senegal: the men with their head under their shoulders,
their eyes in their breast, are the ill-formed negroes, whose shoulders are
shrugged up, and whose heads drop on their breasts: the mermaids of
the Arab tales are the sea-cows of the African rivers, which have feminine
dugs and a face almost human in expression: the huge serpent which
opposed the army of Regulus is now well known as the python: the
burning mountains which Hanno saw, and the sounds of the lutes which
were believed to proceed from the strife of the elements, are only caused
by the poor negroes burning the grass of their hill-tops: the music being
that of their flutes, as I have heard it often in those long and silent
African nights far away.</p>

<p>"Incredulity has now become so vulgar a folly, that one is almost
tempted, out of simple hatred for a fashion, to run into the opposite
extreme. However, I shall content myself with citing evidence respecting
certain unknown, fabulous and monstrous animals of Africa, without committing
myself to an opinion one way or the other; preserving only my
conviction that there is always a basis of truth to the most fantastic fables,
and that, by rejecting without inquiry that which appears incredible, one
throws away ore in which others might have found a jewel. A traveller
should believe nothing, for he will find himself so often deceived: and he
should disbelieve nothing, for he will see so many wonderful things;
he should doubt, he should investigate, and then, perhaps, he may
discover."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span></p>

<p>It was in this spirit that I set out for the interior of Patagonia.
Although the legends of the Indians were manifestly to a large extent
the result of imaginative exaggeration, yet I hoped to find a substratum
of fact below these fancies. After thorough examination, however, I am
obliged to say that I found none. The Indians not only never enter the
Cordillera but avoid the very neighbourhood of the mountains. The
rumours of the Iemisch and the stories concerning it, which, in print, had
assumed a fairly definite form, I found nebulous in the extreme when
investigated on the spot.</p>

<p>Finally, after much investigation I came to the conclusion that the
Indian legends in all probability refer to some large species of otter.
Musters, in his book "At Home with the Patagonians," makes mention of
an animal much feared by the tribe with whom he travelled, which they
called "water-tiger," and which they said lived in a rapid and deep river
near to Nahuel-huapi, a lake the name of which lends colour to the tale,
for it means Tigers' Island. Musters says he himself saw two ostriches,
that, being considered in too poor a condition to be worth taking to camp
for food, were left on the bank of the river referred to, torn and partly
devoured when on the following day he and his party revisited the spot.
Tracks of an animal were also plainly visible leading down into the
water.</p>

<p>Compare this with a story told me by Mr. Von Plaaten Hallermund.
He described the case of a mule which had fallen over a precipice in the
vicinity of the River Deseado. When on the following day the <i>peones</i>
climbed down to salve its cargo, they found the animal on the edge of
the water half eaten, and in its neighbourhood were tracks strange to
them. "Like those of a puma, yet not those of a puma," as they said.</p>

<p>The manager of Messrs. Braun and Blanchard's store at Santa Cruz
gave me a description of a skin brought in by Indians which, though not
a puma-skin, was quite as large as the skin of the common silver-grey
puma generally is. I myself saw a very large otter in the River Senguerr,
but unluckily had not my rifle with me, and although I returned as quickly
with it as I could, all trace of the otter had vanished.</p>

<p>Taking into consideration the amphibious nature attributed by the
Indians to the Iemisch, there seems to be little reason to doubt that the
real animal underlying the rumours of a mysterious monster is a sub-species
of the large Brazilian otter (<i>Lutra brasiliensis</i>).</p>

<p>To return to the possible survival of the Mylodon, as far as our travels
led us both north and south on the eastern side of the Cordillera, we
could discover no trace whatever either by hearsay or from the evidence
of our own experience to warrant the supposition that it continues to
exist to the present day. But there are hundreds of square miles of
dense forest still unexplored along the whole length of the Patagonian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
Andes, and I do not undertake to declare positively that no such animal
exists in some unknown and hidden spot among their recesses.
Roughly speaking, there are many thousand square miles of snowy
summits, ravines, high plateaus and valleys in this region. The task of
finding a final answer to the Mylodon problem on the drag-net principle
of passing to and fro throughout the whole district would be so gigantic
and prolonged where the natural difficulties are great, as to be practically
impossible. Such an answer must be left to time and the slow process
of things. In the meanwhile I can merely state my own conviction that
the odds are very heavily against the chances of such a survival. The
probable habitat of the Mylodon would naturally be the forests. I
penetrated these in more than one direction, and one of the most
striking characteristics of the forests was the absence of animal life,
evidence of which grew less and less the farther we forced our way into
their depths. It is a matter of common knowledge that, where the larger
forms of life are to be found, there also a liberal catalogue of lesser
creatures co-exist. The conditions which favour the life of the greater
favour also the existence of the less. This is presumptive evidence only,
and though it has certainly influenced my own conclusions, I do not
wish to force it upon others. I have stated the case as fairly as I can,
and I leave my readers to form their own opinions.

<h2>APPENDIX B<br />

<span class="s08"><i>On a new Form of Puma from Patagonia.</i></span><br />

<span class="s08">By <span class="smcap">Oldfield Thomas</span>, F.R.S.</span></h2>

<p>The National Collection owes to the generosity of Mr. C. Arthur
Pearson the skin of a fine puma, obtained by Mr. Hesketh Prichard during
the recent <i>Daily Express</i> expedition to Patagonia. The skin is remarkably
unlike any known form of puma, and appears certainly to represent a new
sub-species.</p>

<p>Dr. Matschie has already shown<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> that the red puma of the tropics
to which he restricts the name <i>Felis concolor</i>, is replaced south of 25° S.
lat. by the silver-grey form for which Molina's name, <i>F. puma</i>, is used.</p>

<p>Now, again, south of about 44° S. lat., there proves to be another
form, represented in the British Museum not only by Mr. Prichard's skin
from Santa Cruz, but by a second much younger specimen from the Rio
Senguerr. Both show the same characteristics, and are equally different
from the Argentine silver-grey form.</p>

<p>In commemoration of Mr. Pearson's scientific spirit in sending out the
expedition, and in presenting the specimen to the National Museum, I
would propose to call it</p>

<p class="center"><i>Felis concolor Pearsoni</i>, sub-sp. n.</p>

<p>General build thick and sturdy, with comparatively short limbs and
tail. Fur thick and woolly, the specimens evidently in winter pelage.
General colour nearest to Ridgway's "clay-colour," therefore exceedingly
different from the nearly "drab-grey" of <i>F. c. puma</i>. This colour is
most vivid along the back, paler laterally on the sides, but there is nothing
that can be called a distinct dorsal dark line. Undersurface whitish-fawn,
the hairs sandy at their bases, whiter terminally. Face very much like
back, darker markings practically obsolete; the usual lighter markings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
near the eye present but not conspicuous. Ears of normal length, their
backs uniformly whitish-fawn, without darker markings. Outer sides of
limbs like back, inner sides like belly; ends of fingers and toes whitish,
without any darker markings round the pads. Tail proportionally very
short, brownish clay-colour above, whitish below, the tip not or scarcely
darker.</p>

<p>Dimensions of the typical skin, which has been tanned and stretched,
so that the measurements are merely approximate:&mdash;Head and body
1370 millim., tail 530, ear 80.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Santa Cruz, Patagonia; about 70 miles inland.</p>

<p><i>Type.</i> Female. B.M. No. 1. 8. 12. 1. Brought home by Mr. H.
Prichard and presented by Mr. C. Arthur Pearson.</p>

<p>The skin was bought by Mr. Prichard from Indians in the region
mentioned, so that neither flesh-measurements nor skull were obtained.</p>

<p>The second skin is that of a young male, killed on the Senguerr River,
in March 1897, by one of the collectors from the La Plata Museum, by
whom it was presented to the British Museum. Owing to its youth, its
peculiarities had not been previously noticed.</p>

<p><i>F. c. Pearsoni</i> is distinguished from <i>F. c. puma</i> not only by its very
different general colour, but also by its shorter tail, light-coloured ear-backs,
and the absence of the dark markings round the digital pads.

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Since writing the above I learn that a German line has put steamers upon this
route.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> When a mare is in foal&mdash;as was the case with the black mare&mdash;her troop will
often desert her and wander away, but when the foal is born the horses become very
much attached to it.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Darwin describes the guanaco as "generally wild and extremely wary."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> This happened in the case of two Mausers I had with me. One came off at the
third shot from the mere recoil&mdash;a serious business.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Except in very rare cases the <i>boleadores</i> should not be used to catch horses. For
a kicking animal they are, however, a good corrective.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Any traveller, settler or cattleman who is acquainted with the vagaries of <i>cargueros</i>
will understand our position. Some of the horses which we used as <i>cargueros</i> had
never before had a saddle upon their backs.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> There is, however, a great variation in the development of the lower limbs in
different individuals.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> This name is preferred by the Indians themselves. To call them <i>los Indios</i> is a
breach of etiquette. <i>Paisano</i> means, of course, son of the land, a title in which the
Tehuelche takes pride.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> The evil spirit is supposed to take up its quarters behind the <i>toldos</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> While prosecuting the inquiries which led to the compilation of this account of
the Tehuelches it was thought that the author desired to take a bride from the <i>toldos</i>.
He was informed that seven mares would purchase a young and efficient helpmate.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Tehuelche beauties are not above wearing a tail of false hair.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> On the occasions I describe, even the <i>asadores</i> (iron spits three feet in length and
sharpened at the end which enters the ground) are taken away and buried by the
young women.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> These customs are now dying out.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> According to Tehuelche beliefs, the Good Spirit created the animals in the caves
of a certain mountain called "God's Hill," and gave them to his people for food.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Here I disagree with Captain G. C. Musters, who claims excellent walking powers
for the Tehuelches. That they can walk well if forced to do so is possible, but we need
look no farther than their boots to perceive that they rarely go afoot. The Patagonian
pampas are covered with thorn and the thin foot-covering of the Indians would be torn
to pieces in the course of a two-hours tramp over such ground.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Nansen's "Esquimaux Life."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_17" id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> The Tehuelches are enormously above the Onas of Tierra del Fuego in the scale
of civilisation. A Fuegian woman has been known to live in the Tehuelchian tents,
but how she came there I am unable to say. On the other hand, I have never heard
of any Tehuelche living with the Tierra del Fuegians, and cannot conceive such
a state of things to be possible. But the Tehuelches will mix occasionally with the
Araucanian tribes of Northern Patagonia, and intermarriages are common.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_18" id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> Pampa travel is like cricket in that it defies forecast. Sometimes everything
falls in right, at other times nothing comes opportunely to hand.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_19" id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> I believe, as does Dr. Moreno, that a race of Indians, now extinct, once dwelled
among the foothills of the Cordillera.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_20" id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> This was a very lean buck; a fat doe is excellent.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_21" id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Louis von Plaaten Hallermund, of the Argentine Boundary Commission, almost
reached Lake Buenos Aires from Lake Puerrydon about two years previously.
Mr. Waag had completed the journey, but we did not know this.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_22" id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> A guide who applied to me at Santa Cruz warned me that, if we went without him,
we would have great difficulty at this point. He asked ten dollars a day for his services,
which I, however, declined.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_23" id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> This we came to understand very thoroughly at a later date, when we penetrated
to the end of the long twisting arms of the lake.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_24" id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> To hunt this swampy ground in shooting-boots is an unnecessary handicap, for
the footing is so soft that one sinks to the knee in the worst places. A pair of string-shoes
called "alpargatas" are the most useful and suitable footgear for this work, and
the gain of their lightness is an added advantage.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_25" id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> Where there are sheep, and consequently mutton is procurable, the guanaco is
rarely hunted.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_26" id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> This method has been referred to in another chapter.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_27" id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> This chapter embodies a paper read before the Zoological Society of London on
April 15, 1902, with some additional details.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_28" id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> Two kinds of fish came under my observation, but I understood there were four.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_29" id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> I hope in a future volume to publish a list of the plants we collected. At the
moment of writing all have not reached England.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_30" id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> There were also orchids growing about the foothills of the Cordillera. Those I
brought back are now under the care of the Curator of the Royal Botanical Gardens
at Kew. They should flower before this book is in print.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_31" id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> Burbury made his way south just in the nick of time. I was obliged to send him
to the coast to meet Scrivenor, who was, according to my arrangements, about to
leave for England.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_32" id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> I have watched with considerable interest the methods adopted by the Germans
as opposed to those of the young man of our own race. I remember an instance of a
German who set up as a chemist in a town out Central America way, and whose chief
source of income came from the sale of drugs to rather impressionable negroes. In
his place the Englishman would have laid in decent English drugs, would have sat
behind his counter, and would have dispensed in stolid fashion to the limit of the
abilities with which he was blessed. Not so our German friend. His drugs were good,
but not supremely so; his prices were cost prices, with a mere shaving of profit.</p>

<p class="footnote">But his method was excellent.</p>

<p class="footnote">He made a character-study of each of his customers. He sold a fine tonic, coloured
red and reported invincible. He put the title of Dr. before his name, and advertised
free consultations, provided the patients bought their medicines at his store. He
throve.</p>
